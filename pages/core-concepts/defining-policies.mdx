## Policy
Thus far we've defined our config schemas, uploaded them to Miru, and stored our configuration data in clients and tags. The next step is using policies to format our configuration data according to the config schema used by our clients.

<PolicyDefinition />

## Policy Schema
<PolicySchemaDefinition />

## Override
<Override />

Everything is now in place to deploy concrete configs to our clients. We'll examine this final step in the next section.
