## Clone the Repository
We've created some sample configurations and schemas to quickly get started. To follow 
along, clone the [getting-started](https://github.com/miruml/getting-started) repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miruml/getting-started.git
```

## Application Overview
The application is extremely simple. It defines one config, the "motion control" config, which is read with the Miru SDK and printed to standard output. 

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# python/main.py
```

```rust Rust
// rust/main.rs
```

```cpp C++
// cpp/main.cpp

```
</CodeGroup>

The application has two configuration related folders, one for config schemas and one for concrete configs used in local development. This structure is for demonstration purposes. You can place the schemas and configs anywhere in your project.

The concrete "motion control" config for local development is located at `.../<language-of-choice>/dev-configs/motion-control.yaml` and contains the following data.

```yaml [expandable]
speed: 10
features:
  spin: true
  jump: true
  backflip: false
accelerometer:
  id: acc_id_1
  offsets:
    x: 0.1
    y: 0.13
    z: -0.04
  scaling_factor:
    x: 1.0
    y: 1.02
    z: 0.99
```

The config schema for the "motion control" config is located at `.../<language-of-choice>/schemas/motion-control.yaml` and is defined in JSON Schema as the following.

```yaml [expandable]
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
type: object
properties:
  speed:
    type: integer
    minimum: 1
    default: 10
  features:
    type: object
    properties:
      spin:
        type: boolean
        default: true
      jump:
        type: boolean
        default: false
      backflip:
        type: boolean
        default: false
    required: [spin, jump, backflip]
  accelerometer:
    type: object
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
      offsets:
        type: object
        properties:
          x:
            type: number
          y:
            type: number
          z:
            type: number
        required: [x, y, z]
      scaling_factor:
        type: object
        properties:
          x:
            type: number
          y:
            type: number
          z:
            type: number
        required: [x, y, z]
    required: [id, offsets, scaling_factor]
required: [device_id, speed, features, accelerometer]
```

## Application Setup

Each language has a slightly different setup process for install dependencies and ensuring the application is executable. Navigate to the language specific guide for some quick setup instructions.
