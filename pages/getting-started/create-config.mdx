title: 'Create a Config'
---

This guide assumes you've read the core concepts section on 
[Creating Schemas](/pages/core-concepts/creating-schemas).

## Create Config
After cloning the [getting-started](/pages/getting-started/sample-config.mdx) repository, create a new
[Config](/pages/vocabulary#config) on the [Configs page](https://configs.miruml.com/configs).

<Frame>
    <img 
        src="/images/getting-started/create-config-page.png" 
        alt="Create Config Page" 
    />
</Frame>

Click `+ New Config` and name the config `Robot Features` with slug `robot-features`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/getting-started/create-config-form.png" 
        alt="Create Config Form" 
    />
</Frame>

## Config Slug
The config slug is a unique identifier for your config in your workspace. It's used by 
both the CLI and SDK to link your schema to the right config.

Your JSON Schema file must include a `$miru_config_slug` field at the root level. We've
already included this field in the example schema.

```yaml robot-features.schema.yaml
$miru_config_slug: "robot-features"

```

<Warning>
    Config slugs are permanent and cannot be changed after creation.
