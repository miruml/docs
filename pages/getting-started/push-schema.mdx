title: 'Push the Schema'
---

This guide assumes you've read the core concepts section on 
[Creating Schemas](/pages/core-concepts/creating-schemas#uploading-a-config-schema).

### Commit Changes
Before pushing the schema to Miru, commit any changes to your repository. The CLI needs 
a clean working directory to track schema versions properly.

If you've modified the repository after cloning it, commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "miru getting started guide"
```

### Push to Miru
Now that we've committed our changes, let's push the schema:

```bash
miru schema push ./schemas/robot-features.schema.yaml
```

You'll see a confirmation message that your schema was uploaded.

```bash
üì¶ Attempting to push 1 config schemas...
