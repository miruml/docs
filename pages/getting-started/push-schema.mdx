title: 'Push the Schema'
---

This guide assumes you've read the core concepts section on 
[Creating Schemas](/pages/core-concepts/creating-schemas#uploading-a-config-schema).

### Commit Changes
Let's navigate back to the [getting-started](https://github.com/miruml/getting-started) 
repository and terminal.
 The CLI needs 
a clean working directory to track schema versions properly.

If you've modified the repository after cloning it, commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "getting started guide"
```

### Push to Miru
Now that we've committed our changes, let's push the schema:

```bash
miru schema push ./schemas/mobility.schema.yaml
```

<Note>
    We're specifying the [file path](/pages/getting-started/starter-repo#configuration-schema) 
    to the schema, not the [config slug](/pages/getting-started/create-config#config-slug).
    For more details, see the [CLI Reference](/pages/cli-reference/schema-push).
</Note>

You'll see a confirmation message that your schema was uploaded.

```bash
üì¶ Attempting to push 1 config schemas...
