Instead of using public Docker Hub images like we did with `mongo:4.2.0` image in [Prepare your Application](http://docs.miruml.com/pages/quickstart#prepare-your-application), you can use private images located in your Google Artifact Registry repository. 

To do so, we need to create a service account in your Google Cloud project, add it to `miru`, and grant it read-only access to your chosen Artifact Registry repositories. Follow the steps below to connect `miru` with your Google Artifact Registry.
