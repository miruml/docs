**[Miru](https://app.miruml.com/signin)** is the deployment infrastructure for robotics
and IoT. Miru makes it easy to deploy software over-the-air to fleets of devices, 
anywhere in the world. Simply push new changes to GitHub and let Miru take care of 
the rest.

This **Getting Started** page will walk you through an example set up and 
deployment using Miru. Miru is compatible with any machine running an **Ubuntu** or **Raspberry Pi** operating system with an **aarch64** or **x86_64** architecture (32-bit architectures are not supported). Miru is particularly suited for **NVIDIA Jetson** devices, **Raspberry Pis**, and **industrial PCs**. 

For requests for other devices/OS support, [reach out to a founder](mailto:vedant@miruml.com). **Do not use this in production without talking to a founder first!**
