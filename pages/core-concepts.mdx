## Overview

This page defines the key terminology used in Miru. We recommend you read through the [product tour](/pages/product-tour) and use this page as a reference to gain a concise understanding of how Miru can solve application configuration management for your team. Reading this page alone will not give you a general understanding of how Miru works. This is what the product tour is for.

## Concrete Config

A **concrete config** is a particular instantiation of parameters used to alter the behavior of your code. You're probably storing concrete configs as a JSON or YAML files (or potentially in a database somewhere), which is then parsed into a structured format by your application. The following YAML file defines a concrete config for controlling a robot's motion:

<Accordion title="Concrete Config Example">
```yaml
speed: 10
features:
	spin: true
	jump: true
	backflip: false
accelerometer:
	id: acc_id_1
	offsets:
		x: 0.1
		y: 0.13
		z: -0.04
	scaling_factor:
		x: 1.0
		y: 1.02
		z: 0.99
```
</Accordion>

## Config Schema

<ConfigSchemaDefinition />

Miru officially supports JSON Schema, which is widely used and supports [code generation](https://quicktype.io/) in a variety of languages. However, we will be adding support for other configuration languages in the near future. Here are some popular ones:
- [CUE Language](https://cuelang.org/)
- [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/index.html)
- [Type Schema](https://typeschema.org/)
- [JSON Type Definition](https://jsontypedef.com/)
- [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/)

## Config
In Miru a **config** represents the parameters responsible for configuring a particular aspect of your application *through time*. For instance, your application may have a "motion control" config which is responsible for controlling the motion of your robot. The motion control config goes through many iterations--parameters are added or deprecated (creating new config schemas for the config) and given different values (creating new concrete configs for the config). The motion control config is not a particular instatiation of parameters nor is it a particular specification of constraints. Instead it is the parameters which are responsible for configuring the motion of your robot at any point in your application's lifecycle.
