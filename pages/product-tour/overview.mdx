## Product Tour Overview
This product tour provides a concise understanding of Miru's core offering, demonstrating Miru's solution to application configurations for robotics. This is **NOT a tutorial** detailing the installation and usage of Miru in depth. For this you should refer to the [Getting Started](/pages/getting-started/install-cli) guide (although we still recommend you read through this product tour beforehand). 

This product tour will walkthrough the Miru workflow to deploy a [concrete config](/pages/core-concepts#concrete-config) to a [client](/pages/core-concepts#client). It glosses over detailed installation and usage instructions in favor of a general understanding of what using Miru looks like in practice. 

This tour will reference terminology defined in the [core concepts](/pages/core-concepts) page. You may find it helpful to skim through this page to familiarize yourself with some of the terminology before continuing with the product tour.

## Workflow Primer

As a brief primer, there are four main steps in the Miru workflow. The product tour will show each of these steps, giving you a general understanding of how Miru works.
