## Welcome
Welcome to Miru! **[Miru](https://configs.miruml.com/configs)** is an application configuration management solution for robotics teams. Miru provides tools for engineers to define, deploy, and manage application configurations for their robots in a simple, reliable, and scalable manner.

## Difficulties of Configurations
Robots have a plethora of application configurations stemming from various sources. Here are some of the most common.

- **Calibrations** - various end effectors, grippers, sensors, etc., require calibrations unique to each unit.
- **Hardware Variability** - different devices or systems may be used, requiring configurations to set the appropriate software dependencies and functionalities the hardware supports.
- **User Preferences** - end users of a robot may require or desire different configurations for the same application.
- **Testing & Development** - testing, beta, and production robots require different configurations for testing and rolling out new features.

These configurations quickly become difficult to manage on a variety of dimensions.

### Complex Groupings
Many configurations are shared by different groupings of robots in your fleet. For example, certain functionalities may be enabled or disabled for a given robot depending on the hardware variant, customer, or test environment that the robot belongs to. 

These variations often overlap in complex ways. Hardware variants may be spread across different customers, and customers may opt in to be beta testers for early releases. 

These complex relationships make it difficult to express the configurations a robot should have and to alter the configurations for robots in your fleet safely. 

### Configuration Volume
Robots often require unique configurations, especially calibrations for end effectors and grippers. With such volume, associating robots with their correct calibration data can be tricky and error-prone. 

Even more, determining information about the configurations currently in use by your fleet, how those configurations have changed over time, and how configurations compare between robots in your fleet becomes difficult (even with only 10 or 20 robots). 

### Robot as the Source of Truth
For many robotics teams, the robot is the source of truth for configurations. While many configurations may be defined in the cloud and deployed to the fleet, some configurations are locally edited on a robot and later backed up to the cloud. 

For instance, robots may be recalibrated at regular intervals. This data is stored directly on the device and later backed up to the cloud (if at all). 

It's expected that robots lose internet connection, so configurations locally edited on a robot cannot always be immediately synced to the cloud. This requires an involved syncing mechanism so that locally edited configurations are synced to the cloud and configurations set in the cloud are synced to the robot. 

Tracking the history of configurations and who made them thus becomes more challenging due to the origins of configurations in both the cloud and on the robot.

### User-Facing Configurations
A final dimension of complexity is the need to expose configurations to robot users. While this is wildly use-case dependent, it's common to allow users to alter configurations that affect the robot's behavior.

This adds another layer to tracking the history of configurations and who made them, as third parties (namely your users) are now involved as well. Questions about who is even allowed to change a configuration become more pressing. 

More interesting product questions around what configurations users are selecting and how the performance of a robot is affected by certain configurations begin to surface as well.

## Miru's Solution
Miru is a purpose-built solution for managing the complexities of application configurations in robotics. We put the developer first, prioritizing simplicity and developer experience. As a brief primer, there are four stages in the configuration management lifecycle with Miru.
