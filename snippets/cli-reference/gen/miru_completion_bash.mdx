### Command

```bash
miru completion bash
```

### Description

Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(miru completion bash)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	miru completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/miru

#### macOS:

	miru completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/miru

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.



### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for bash
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -q, --quiet   suppress output except errors
```
