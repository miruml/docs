### Command

```bash
miru completion zsh [flags]
```

### Description

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

```bash
source <(miru completion zsh)
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

```bash
miru completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_miru"
```

#### macOS:

```bash
miru completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_miru
```

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.



### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -q, --quiet   suppress output except errors
```
