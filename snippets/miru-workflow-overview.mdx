<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Schemas">
    [Config schemas](/docs/basics/vocabulary#config-schema) are defined in a git repository and used to validate [config instances](/docs/basics/vocabulary#config-instance) 
    before deployment. Once ready to deploy a new version of your application, these 
    schemas are uploaded to Miru via the command-line interface or in a continuous 
    integration pipeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Configuration Data">
    Configuration data used to generate config instances is defined and stored in the cloud. Configuration data is edited in the Miru dashboard or programmatically with the Miru REST API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Overrides">
    [Overrides](/docs/basics/vocabulary#policy) are created to determine how configuration data is evaluated to produce config instances. Like configuration data, overrides live in the cloud and are edited in the Miru dashboard or programmatically with the Miru REST API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Config instances are deployed to robots via the [Miru SDK](/docs/sdk-reference). The SDK fetches updated config instances from the cloud, making them readily available to your application.
