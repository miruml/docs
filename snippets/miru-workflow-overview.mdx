<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Schemas">
    [Config schemas](/pages/vocabulary#config-schema) are defined in a git repository alongside code, and are used to validate [concrete configs](/pages/vocabulary#concrete-config) before deployment. Once ready to deploy a new version of your application, these schemas are uploaded to Miru using the Miru command-line interface or a continuous integration pipeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Configuration Data">
    Configuration data used to determine concrete configs for each robot is defined and stored in the cloud. This data can be edited in the Miru dashboard or programmatically with the Miru REST API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Policies">
    [Policies](/pages/vocabulary#policy) are created to determine how configuration data is formatted and evaluated as concrete configs deployed to robots. Like configuration data, policies live in the cloud and can be edited via the Miru dashboard or programmatically via the Miru REST API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Concrete configs are deployed to clients via the [Miru SDK](/pages/guides/sdk). The SDK fetches updated configurations from the cloud, making them readily available to your application.
