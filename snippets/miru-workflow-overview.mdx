<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Schemas">
    [Config schemas](/docs/basics/vocabulary#config-schema) are defined in a git repository and used to validate [config instances](/docs/basics/vocabulary#config-instance)
    before deployment. Once ready to deploy a new version of an application, these
    schemas are uploaded to Miru via the command-line interface or in a continuous
    integration pipeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Configuration Data">
    Configuration data used to render config instances is defined and stored in the cloud. Configuration data is edited in the Miru dashboard or programmatically with the Miru REST API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Overrides">
    [Overrides](/docs/basics/vocabulary#policy) are created to determine how configuration data is rendered to produce config instances. Like configuration data, overrides live in the cloud and are edited in the Miru dashboard or programmatically with the Miru REST API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Config instances are deployed to robots via the [Miru Agent](/docs/agent-sdk/install-agent) and the [Miru SDK](/docs/sdk-reference). The agent fetches updated config instances from the cloud and serves them to applications running the SDK on the same device.
