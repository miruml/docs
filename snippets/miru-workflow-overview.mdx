<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Schemas">
    [Config schemas](/pages/vocabulary#config-schema) are defined in a git repository 
    alongside code and are used to validate [concrete configs](/pages/vocabulary#concrete-config) 
    before deployment. Once ready to deploy a new version of your application, these 
    schemas are uploaded to Miru using the Miru command-line interface or a continuous 
    integration pipeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Configuration Data">
    Configuration data used to generate concrete configs is defined and stored in the cloud. Configuration data is edited in the Miru dashboard or programmatically with the Miru REST API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Overrides">
    [Overrides](/pages/vocabulary#policy) are created to determine how configuration data is evaluated to produce concrete configs. Like configuration data, overrides live in the cloud and are edited in the Miru dashboard or programmatically with the Miru REST API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Concrete configs are deployed to robots via the [Miru SDK](/pages/guides/sdk). The SDK fetches updated configurations from the cloud, making them readily available to your application.
