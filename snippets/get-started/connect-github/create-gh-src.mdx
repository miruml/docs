After the installation completes, you'll be redirected to the
[integrations](https://app.miruml.com/integrations/github) page in Miru. Wait a
few seconds before refreshing the page to see your updated repository access.

After connecting a GitHub repository, you'll need to create a **GitHub Source**. A GitHub Source is uniquely identified by three items:

1. Repository - the GitHub repository (ex: miru-examples)
2. Branch - the branch for the repository (ex: main)
3. Build Directory - the folder in the repository housing a docker-compose.yaml file (ex: /backend)

<div style={{
display: 'flex',
flexDirection: 'row',
alignItems: 'center',
justifyContent: 'flex-start',
}}>
<img height="200" src="/images/todo-source.png" style={{ 
borderRadius: '7px',
flex: 1,
maxWidth: '250px',
marginRight: '40px',
}} />
<p style={{ flex: 1}}>
Note that you can create multiple sources from the same repository, provided
each source has a unique branch and build directory combination.

To create a GitHub source, click the **Source** button, fill in the fields,
and click **Create Source**. We'll set up our GitHub source to track the
`\todo` in the `main` branch of our forked `miru-examples` repository and name
the source *To Do*.

The default architecture for a new GitHub source is **aarch64**. However, you can also use **x86_64** as well. GitHub sources with an aarch64 architecture will create artifacts supported for 64-bit ARM devices (NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, etc.) while GitHub sources with an x86_64 architecture will create artifacts supported for 64-bit x86 machines (e.g. industrial PCs)
