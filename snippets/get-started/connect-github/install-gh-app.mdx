Miru integrates with your GitHub account for a seamless deployment experience. To begin, navigate to the integrations page in `miru` by clicking the [Integrations](https://app.miruml.com/integrations/github) tab in the top left of the home page.

Before connecting your GitHub account, we'll fork the [Miru Examples](https://github.com/miruml/examples) repository to use throughout this getting started guide to show you how to deploy with `miru`. We **highly** encourage you to follow along with us.

To use this repository with us, click [Miru Examples repository](https://github.com/miruml/examples) and fork the
repository by clicking the Fork button in the top right of the repository
screen on GitHub.

Rename the repository to *miru-examples* and choose the owner as your personal
GitHub account (we're using *mirueng*). If using an organization's account, the organization owner may
need to grant you permission to fork the repository into the organization's
namespace and create a new repository.

You should now see the *miru-examples* repository on your GitHub account.

Select the GitHub account that you just created the repository with. For us, that's *miru-eng*.

Select the **miru-examples** repository to grant Miru access and click **Save**. You can add other repositories or change Miru's access to your GitHub repositories
at any time. If you're adding Miru under an GitHub organization account, the organization owner may need to grant Miru access themselves.
