To deploy an artifact to your devices, click the ellipsis on the far right of the artifact you want to deploy and select "Deploy" from the dropdown menu.

If a deployment currently on a device is from an artifact with the same GitHub source as the artifact being deployed, then the new deployment will replace this old deployment.

A popup will appear, allowing you to select which devices you would like to deploy the artifact to. Device's with a deployment already running the chosen artifact will not appear (since the artifact is already deployed). 

<div style={{
 borderRadius: '7px',
 display: 'flex',
 flexDirection: 'row',
 alignItems: 'center',
 justifyContent: 'flex-start',
}}>
<p style={{ flex: 1}}>
 
For example, consider Artifact A and Artifact B, which both have the same GitHub Source C. If a device has a deployment running Artifact A and we're deploying Artifact B, the new deployment running Artifact B will replace the deployment running Artifact A. However, if Artifact B has GitHub Source D (instead of GitHub Source C), then the new deployment running Artifact B will simply deploy alongside the deployment running Artifact A (devices can run more than one deployment).

After selecting the devices to deploy to and clicking "Deploy", the deployments will be queued, awaiting the devices to notice the new deployment and take appropriate action.
