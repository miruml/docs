Scrolling down to the Devices portion of the Group page, you'll find a preview of the information about the device. An overall device status as well as a count of the deployments and their containers are shown for convenience.


<img src="/images/devices-during-deployment.png" style={{borderRadius: '7px'}}/>

Clicking on the name of a device, we can see more detailed information, including the state of its deployments and containers. Each deployment shows its state (queued, downloading, running, etc.), the artifact ID it is running, the deployment ID, and the GitHub Source. By clicking the ellipsis for a deployment, you can start, stop, or remove a deployment from that device.

Scrolling down you'll find all the containers on the device. Again, clicking the ellipsis will allow you to start or stop a given container from the convenience of our UI.

To verify the deployment is running your device, open the terminal on your device and view its containers.

```bash
docker ps
```


You should see 3 containers: a backend, a frontend, and mongo (the redis container is irrelevant here).

  ```

  ```

Furthermore, you should see these exact same containers in the `miru` UI for this device as well. 

If you have access to your device's browser you can navigate to localhost and view the Todo application running on your device.

**Congratulations!** You've made your first OTA deployment with Miru.
