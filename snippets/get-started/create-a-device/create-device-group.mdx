Navigate to the devices page and create a Device Group. Device Groups are a
convenient way to organize your devices. You might create a group for a
specific functionality, different customers, a set of test devices, etc.

In general, device groups are meant to organize your devices. You can use devices of different hardware types (NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, etc.) in the same group as well easily move devices between groups later if you'd like. 

<div style={{
    borderRadius: '7px',
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
}}>
<p style={{ flex: 1}}>
    Each Device Group is connected to one or more GitHub sources. This allows you to use multiple GitHub sources (from potentially different repositories) to deploy code to your devices. On the other hand, you can use the same GitHub sources across different groups so that groups or organized by customer or region, but the devices in the group still have the same code being deployed to them.

    When creating a Device Group, simply name the group and select the GitHub
    Source. We'll name ours *Example Group* and set the GitHub Source to be the
    *To Do* source we just created.
