If you don't have docker installed already, don't worry. Miru will handle the installation for you. First, select the OS your device is running on. Currently, Miru only supports Ubuntu.

<pre><code className="language-bash">
? We've autodetected your operating system to be Ubuntu.
Please confirm this selection or, if this is incorrect, please select your operating system from the list below:
‚ùØ  Ubuntu
Raspberry Pi

</code></pre>

The `miru` installer will quickly test if Docker is installed on your device and if it is compatible with `miru`. 

<pre><code className="language-bash">
Miru requires Docker and Docker Compose (Version 2!)
To ensure compatibility with Miru, we will quickly test your Docker installation with our software

\ Testing Docker Installation
</code></pre>

If Docker is not installed or is not compatible with `miru`, you'll be asked to let the `miru` installer install/upgrade Docker for you. This is done using [this bash script](https://miruml.notion.site/Docker-Installation-Script-e11b5fd27f8547b1ab4622913dd18447?pvs=4), which executes the [Official Docker Installation Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) for the OS your device is running on. 
If you're upgrading your Docker installation, existing Docker resources (containers, images, networks, etc.) **will be left untouched** and will continue running after the installation is complete.
{/* TODO: Should I make this on a Mintlify page?*/}
Once the bash script completes, the `miru` installer will again test if the Docker installation is compatible (which it should be), after which it will automatically move on to authenticating your device.
