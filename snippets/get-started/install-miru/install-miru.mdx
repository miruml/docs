Installing Miru onto your device takes 3 minutes.  The only dependencies for Miru are `docker`, `docker compose`, and `miru`. If you don't have `docker` or `docker compose` installed already don't worry, Miru will handle the installation for you! 

We highly recommend **to SSH into your device** so that you can easily copy and paste your authentication token from your local computer.

Please note that `miru` is compatible with any machine running an **Ubuntu** or **Raspberry Pi** operating system with an **aarch64** or **x86_64** architecture (32-bit architectures are not supported). Miru is particularly suited for **NVIDIA Jetson** devices, **Raspberry Pis**, and **industrial PCs**. 

#### 1. **Install `miru`**

Run the following command to install `miru`, which will download and execute this [installation script](https://miruml.notion.site/Miru-Installation-Script-b7d6895d7d8d40cb868987585dc4a65b). 

{/* Should I keep this on Notion or make a Mintlify page? */}
```
curl https://api.miruml.com/v1/install.sh -sSf | sudo /bin/sh
```
`curl`: curl is a command-line tool used to transfer data from or to a server. In this case we're using it to download the `miru` installation script shell script from the Miru servers to your local computer.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install curl
    ```

<Accordion icon="question" title="Want to know how the command works?">
- `http://api.miruml.com/v1/install.sh`: The URL which resolves to the Miru servers for the curl request
- `s`: Runs `curl` in silent mode, suppressing progress and error messages.
- `S`: In combination with `s`, it makes `curl` show error messages if any occur.
- `f`: Makes `curl` fail silently (without outputting the body) on server errors (e.g., 404 or 500 HTTP status codes).
- `|` (pipe): The pipe (`|`) is a Unix command that takes the output of the command on its left (in this case, the output of `curl`) and uses it as the input to the command on its right.
- `sudo`: Runs the following command (`/bin/bash`) with superuser (root) privileges. This is needed to install `miru` as a Debian package
- `/bin/sh`: The Shell, which is used to execute the `miru` installation script on your local system.
