Miru utilizes [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to deploy your application. This section will walk through the setup of your application with Docker Compose to deploy to `miru`. We'll use the [Miru Examples repository](https://github.com/miruml/demo) you forked in the [Connect to GitHub](#install-the-github-app) section. 

Ensure you're using a **development machine** for this section. This should be a computer that has pull/push access to your GitHub account. We recommend using a computer different from the device you installed `miru` onto. Although, you could use the same device if that's all you have access to.

First clone your ***miru-examples*** repository.

``` bash
# your repo url should like similar to: https://github.com/<your-username>/miru-examples.git
# ours is https://github.com/miru-eng/miru-examples.git when using the 'miru-eng' account
git clone YOUR-MIRU-EXAMPLE-REPOSITORY-URL
```

Navigate inside the ***miru-examples*** directory.

``` bash
cd miru-examples
```

Your directory structure should look similar to the following:

```plaintext
miru-examples/
├── todo/
│   └── ...
├── simple-torch/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Open the **/todo** directory in your favorite code editor to examine the code and containers that will be deployed onto your device. While there are other folders within the miru-examples repository, we setup a singel GitHub Source in our Device Group, which looks at the **todo** folder. This was specified by inputting the build path as **/todo** when [creating the Device Group](#create-a-device-group).


The todo folder has the following structure:

```plaintext
todo/
├── compose.yaml
├── backend/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── ...
└── frontend/
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── ...
```

The first (and maybe most important) file is the `compose.yaml` file. This specifies what docker services (containers) to run, how they should interact with the host machine, and how to build or pull the images these services will run.

For example, the **frontend** service contains the following build specification:

```yaml
frontend:
    build:
    context: frontend
    target: development
    ...
```

The `frontend.build` parameters specify where the Dockerfile for this service is located in the filesystem and any information required to build the Docker image. 

The `frontend.build.context` parameter tells Docker Compose to look inside the **frontend** directory that is located within the parent directory of the **compose.yaml** file's parent directory. For example, since the compose.yaml file's path is **/todo/compose.yaml**, Docker Compose will look for a Dockerfile at **/todo/frontend/Dockerfile**.

Similarly, the **backend** service's build specification is:

```yaml
backend:
    build:
    context: backend
    target: development
```
So Docker Compose will look for the backend service's Dockerfile at `/todo/backend/Dockerfile`. If you look within these folders you'll find Dockerfiles in each of them.

```plaintext
todo/
│
├── compose.yaml
├── backend/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── ...
└── frontend/
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── ...
```
The Dockerfiles specify how to build their respective service (frontend or backend) into a [Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/build/). This process is crucial for creating a consistent and reproducible environment for the application.

The **mongo** service is the last service defined in the compose.yaml file. Notably, it does not have a build parameter. Instead, it uses an image parameter ([mongo:4.2.0](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)) to specify the Docker image to pull from Docker Hub. This approach ensures that the service uses a specific version of the MongoDB image.

```yaml
mongo:
    restart: always
    image: mongo:4.2.0
```

These services work together to create a simple web application that can be accessed on localhost to create a ToDo list. After deploying this application, you will be able to navigate to localhost on the device in which the application is deployed and see the following:
