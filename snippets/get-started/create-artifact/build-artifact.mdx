To use `miru` with your docker compose setup, simply ensure your **docker-compose.yml** is located in the directory specified by your GitHub Source. For us that would be **.../miru-examples/todo/compose.yml** since we specified our GitHub Source directory to be **/todo** and our repository lives in the **miru-examples** directory. Your compose file can be named **compose** or **docker-compose** with a file extension of **yaml** or **yml** (compose.yml, compose.yaml, docker-compose.yml, or docker-compose.yaml).

Ensure you're using a **development machine** for this section. This should be a computer that has pull/push access to your GitHub account. We recommend using a computer different from the device you installed `miru` onto. Although, you could use the same device if that's all you have access to.

With our application ready, we'll navigate back to our **miru-examples** repository, add a change, and push to GitHub.

```
# This is an arbitrary change to push a new commit to GitHub
# Feel free to push whatever arbitrary change you'd like 
echo "Hello Miru!" >> miru.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Test Miru deployment"
```
Upon pushing to GitHub, Miru receives the push event and begins building your containers on our servers. You'll be able to see the progress of this **Artifact** being built on the **Group** page the device is located in.

Your artifact will transition through 5 different states before it is ready for deployment.

1. **Queued** -> Waiting for a build server to become available to build your artifact
2. **Verifying** -> Verifying your Docker Compose file and build specifications are valid
3. **Building** -> Building your Docker images
4. **Storing** -> Storing your images in our private container registry
5. **Ready** -> The artifact is ready to be deployed to your devices.
