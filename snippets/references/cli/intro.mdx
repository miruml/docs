The Miru Command Line Interface (CLI) is used to define and upload config schemas to Miru. The CLI is also a convenient tool for managing Miru resources from your development machine's terminal rather than the web interface.

The CLI does NOT talk to the Miru Agent and should not be used on devices running the Miru Agent. The CLI should only be installed and used on your development machine.
