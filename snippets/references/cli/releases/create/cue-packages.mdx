[CUE](/docs/learn/schemas/languages/cue) supports the concept of a [package](https://cuelang.org/docs/tour/packages/packages/)—a way to spread a schema's definition across multiple files. 

For example, say we have a `communication` schema which contains the following files:

<Tree.Folder name="communication" defaultOpen>
  <Tree.File name="peripherals.cue" />
  <Tree.File name="network.cue" />
  <Tree.File name="sensors.cue" />
  <Tree.File name="main.cue" />
</Tree.Folder>

Each file defines a portion of the schema, which is then aggregated by the `main.cue` file to define the schema. Miru fully supports CUE packages, treating the `communication` directory as a single schema.

**Identifying packages**

The Miru CLI automatically identifies CUE packages for you when creating a release using the `package` clause at the top of each schema file (as described in the [CUE documentation](https://cuelang.org/docs/tour/packages/packages/)).

You don't need to explicitly specify the package in the CLI command--just provide the path to the package directory or to the individual schema files within the package.

**Annotations**

To annotate a CUE package, annotate **exactly one file** in the package. Annotating multiple files or no files will result in an error.
