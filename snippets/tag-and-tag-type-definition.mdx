A **tag type** is a group of related tags, while a **tag** is an instantiation of a tag type. Examples illustrate this best.

A `hardware` tag type could be used to group clients based on the hardware they run on: `Raspberry Pi 4 Model B`, `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano`, and `NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX`.

An `environment` tag type could group clients based on the stage of development they are in: `Dev`, `QA`, `Beta`, and `Stable`.

An `accelerometer` tag type could define a tag for each accelerometer: `Accelerometer 1`, `Accelerometer 2`, `Accelerometer 3`, `Accelerometer 4`, etc. A client's accelerometer tag would reflect the specific accelerometer in use by the client, which may change as accelerometers are replaced or upgraded.

As the name suggests, clients can be "tagged" with a particular tag.
