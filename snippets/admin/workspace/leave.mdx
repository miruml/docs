Leaving a workspace removes all access to your workspace:
- You are immediately logged out
- Signing into Miru with the same email address creates a new workspace with a new account

Leaving a workspace is reversible *if you are not the only <Tooltip tip="A member with access to the workspace (they have not left or been suspended)">active member</Tooltip>*--an admin can invite you back to the workspace at any time.

However, if you are the only active member of a workspace, leaving the workspace will delete the workspace and all associated resources.

To leave your workspace, navigate to the [profile](https://app.miruml.com/settings/profile) page and click **Leave workspace**.

If the **leave workspace** button is disabled, you are not the only member of the workspace and first need to [transfer ownership](/docs/admin/workspace#transfer-ownership) of the workspace to another member.
