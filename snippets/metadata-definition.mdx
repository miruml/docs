**Metadata** is data stored about a particular client or tag. 

For example, your robot may only support certain features based on its hardware. You can store this information as metadata for each tag in your `hardware` tag type. 

For example, maybe your robots running the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` hardware type can only support the `jump` and `spin` features but not the `backflip` feature. You can store this information as metadata in Miru.

Similarly, you may want to store unique data for each of your clients, such as an ID. Miru allows you to store arbitrary metadata for each client as well. Here, we're storing `robot_id` as metadata for our client.
