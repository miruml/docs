**Metadata** is data stored about a particular client or tag. 

For example, some robots may support certain features depending on their hardware. This information can be stored as metadata for each tag in the `hardware` tag type. 

Let's say robots running the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` can support the `jump` and `spin` features but not the `backflip` feature. This information can be stored as metadata for the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` tag.

Similarly, clients may have unique data of their own, such as an ID. Miru allows the storage of arbitrary metadata for each client. In this example, `robot_id` is stored as metadata for a client.
