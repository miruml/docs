import {ACTIVE_TOOLTIP, LEFT_TOOLTIP} from '/snippets/components/users/statuses.jsx';

Leaving a workspace removes all access to your workspace and sets your status to <Tooltip tip={LEFT_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={LEFT_TOOLTIP.cta} href={LEFT_TOOLTIP.href}>left</Tooltip>:

- You are immediately logged out
- You cannot login to this workspace or access any resources (signing in with the same email address creates a new workspace with a new account)

Leaving a workspace is reversible if you are _not the only active member_. An admin can invite you back to the workspace at any time.

However, if you are _the only_ active member of a workspace, leaving the workspace will delete the workspace and all associated resources.

To leave your workspace, navigate to the [Profile page](https://app.miruml.com/settings/profile) and click **Leave workspace**.

If the **leave workspace** button is disabled, you are not the only member of the workspace and must first [transfer ownership](/docs/admin/workspace#transfer-ownership) to another member.
