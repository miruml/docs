import {ACTIVE_TOOLTIP, LEFT_TOOLTIP} from '/snippets/components/users/statuses.jsx';

Leaving a workspace removes all access to your workspace and sets your status to <Tooltip tip={LEFT_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={LEFT_TOOLTIP.cta} href={LEFT_TOOLTIP.href}>left</Tooltip>:
- You are immediately logged out
- You cannot login to this workspace or access any resources (signing in with the same email address creates a new workspace with a new account)

Leaving a workspace is reversible if you are *not the only <Tooltip tip={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.href}>active member</Tooltip>*--an admin can invite you back to the workspace at any time.

However, if you are *the only* active member of a workspace, leaving the workspace will delete the workspace and all associated resources.

To leave your workspace, navigate to the [profile](https://app.miruml.com/settings/profile) page and click **Leave workspace**.

If the **leave workspace** button is disabled, you are not the only member of the workspace and first need to [transfer ownership](/docs/admin/workspace#transfer-ownership) of the workspace to another member.
