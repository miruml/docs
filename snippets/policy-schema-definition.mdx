A **policy schema** defines the constraints on the output of a policy's evaluation. As with a config schema or a metadata schema, policy schemas are written in a configuration language like JSON Schema. Here is an example of a policy schema.

<Accordion title="Policy Schema Example">
```yaml
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
type: object
properties:
  mode:
    type: string
	default: "normal"
  maxSpeed:
    type: integer
    minimum: 1
    default: 1
  features:
    type: object
    properties:
      spin:
        type: boolean
        default: true
      jump:
        type: boolean
        default: false
      backflip:
        type: boolean
        default: false
    required: [spin, jump, backflip]
  accelerometer:
    type: object
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
      offsets:
        type: object
        properties:
          x:
            type: number
          y:
            type: number
          z:
            type: number
        required: [x, y, z]
      scaling_factor:
        type: object
        properties:
          x:
            type: number
          y:
            type: number
          z:
            type: number
        required: [x, y, z]
    required: [id, offsets, scaling_factor]
required: [device_id, speed, features, accelerometer]
```

Although config schemas and policy schemas interact with each other, they serve different purposes. 

Config schemas refer to a policy for evaluating a concrete config for a client. Config schemas can only refer to a policy if the config schema is compatible with the policy's schema. Thus, the policy schema constrains the output of a policy to ensure it is compatible with any config schemas using the policy.
