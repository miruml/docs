An **override** references tag metadata 
that "overrides" the default configuration values of the config schema. Here is a 
`hardware` override example.

The default values in the config schema are shown on the left. On the right is the 
hardware override, which references the `supports_jump`, `supports_spin`, and 
`supports_backflip` fields in the metadata schema for the `hardware` tag type. 

Overrides are completely named and defined by you. An override does not need to specify 
all the fields in a config schema, only a subset of the config schema fields. However, 
it cannot specify fields not present in the config schema.

Overrides can only be evaluated given a particular tag. For instance, the 
`features.jump`, `features.spin`, and `features.backflip` fields in the hardware 
override reference the `supports_jump`, `supports_spin`, and `supports_backflip` fields 
in the metadata schema for the `hardware` tag type.

Given the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` tag, the hardware override would use 
- `features.jump: true`
- `features.spin: true`
- `features.backflip: false` 

since the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` tag has 

- `supports_jump: true`
- `supports_spin: true`
- `supports_backflip: false`

This would override the default values in the config schema, changing `features.spin` 
from `false` to `true`.

Overrides are hierarchically evaluated to determine a config instance for a device. The 
device's tags determine the specific values referenced by overrides.

Combining tags with overrides provides a flexible method to evaluate configuration 
data unique to each device that's formatted according to a given config schema.
