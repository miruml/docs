An **override** references tag metadata to "override" the default configuration values of a config schema. Here is a `hardware` override example.

The default values in the config schema are shown on the left. On the right is the
hardware override, which references the `supports_jump`, `supports_spin`, and
`supports_backflip` fields in the metadata schema for the `hardware` tag type.

Overrides are completely named and defined by you. An override does not need to specify
all the fields in a config schema, only a subset of the config schema fields. However,
it cannot specify fields not present in the config schema.

Overrides can only be evaluated given a particular tag. For instance, the
`features.jump`, `features.spin`, and `features.backflip` fields in the hardware
override reference the `supports_jump`, `supports_spin`, and `supports_backflip` fields
in the metadata schema for the `hardware` tag type.

Given the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` tag, the hardware override would use

- `features.jump: true`
- `features.spin: true`
- `features.backflip: false`

since the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` tag has

- `supports_jump: true`
- `supports_spin: true`
- `supports_backflip: false`

This would override the default values in the config schema, changing `features.spin`
from `false` to `true`.

Overrides are hierarchically evaluated to determine the config instance for a particular device. The device's tags determine the specific values referenced by overrides.

Combining tags with overrides provides a flexible method for rendering configuration data unique to each device that is assured to conform to a given config schema.
