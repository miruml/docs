**Metadata** is data stored about a particular tag.

Suppose a robots support certain features based on hardware. This information can be stored as metadata for each tag in the `hardware` tag type.

For example, say robots powered by the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` can support the
`jump` and `spin` features but not the `backflip` feature. This information can be
stored as metadata for the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` tag.
