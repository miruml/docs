**Metadata** is data stored about a particular tag. 

Maybe robots support certain features based on their hardware. This information can be 
stored as metadata for each tag in the `hardware` tag type. 

For example, let's say robots running the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` can support the 
`jump` and `spin` features but not the `backflip` feature. This information can be 
stored as metadata for the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` tag.
