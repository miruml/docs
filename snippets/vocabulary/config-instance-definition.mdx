A **config instance** is a particular instantiation of parameters used to alter the 
behavior of your code. 

You're probably storing config instances as JSON or YAML files (or potentially in a 
database somewhere), which your application parses into a structured format for 
consumption. The following YAML file defines a config instance for controlling a 
robot's motion.

```yaml
max_linear_speed_mps: 1.2
max_angular_speed_radps: 1.0
obstacle_avoidance_enabled: true
navigation_mode: balanced
telemetry:
  upload_interval_sec: 60
  heartbeat_interval_sec: 10
```
