A **config** represents the parameters responsible for configuring a particular aspect 
of your application *through time*. 

For instance, your application may have a `Mobility` config that controls the 
motion of your robot. The `Mobility` config goes through many iterations--parameters 
are added or deprecated (creating new config schemas for the config) and given different 
values (creating new concrete configs for the config). 

The `Mobility` config is not a particular instantiation of parameters or a 
particular specification of constraints. Instead, it is the parameters responsible for 
configuring the motion of your robot at any point in your application's lifecycle.
