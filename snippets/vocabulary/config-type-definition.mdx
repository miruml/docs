A **config type** represents the parameters responsible for configuring a particular aspect of an application _through time_.

For instance, an application may have a `Mobility` config type that controls the motion of a robot. The `Mobility` config type goes through many iterations--parameters
are added or deprecated (creating new config schemas for the config type) and given different
values (creating new config instances for the config type).

The `Mobility` config type is not a particular instantiation of parameters or a particular specification of constraints. Instead, it is the parameters responsible for configuring the motion of a robot at any point in an application's lifecycle.
