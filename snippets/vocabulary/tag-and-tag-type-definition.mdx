A **tag type** is a group of related tags, while a **tag** is an instantiation of a tag 
type. Examples illustrate this best.

A `hardware` tag type could be used to group clients based on their hardware: 
- `Raspberry Pi 4 Model B`
- `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano`
- `NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX`

An `environment` tag type could group clients based on their stage of development: 
- `Dev`
- `QA`
- `Beta`
- `Stable`

An `accelerometer` tag type could define a tag for each accelerometer: 
- `Accelerometer 1`
- `Accelerometer 2`
- `Accelerometer 3`
- `Accelerometer 4`

A client's accelerometer tag would reflect the specific accelerometer in use by the 
client, which may change as accelerometers are replaced or upgraded.

As the name suggests, clients can be "tagged" with a particular tag.
