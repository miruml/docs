A **tag type** is a group of related tags, while a **tag** is an instantiation of a tag
type. Examples illustrate this best.

A `hardware` tag type could be used to group devices based on their hardware:

- `Raspberry Pi 4 Model B`
- `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano`
- `NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX`

An `environment` tag type could group devices based on their stage of development:

- `Dev`
- `QA`
- `Beta`
- `Stable`

An `accelerometer` tag type could define a tag for each accelerometer:

- `Accelerometer 1`
- `Accelerometer 2`
- `Accelerometer 3`
- `Accelerometer 4`

A device's accelerometer tag reflects the specific accelerometer in use by the device, which may change as accelerometers are replaced or upgraded.

Devices may be "tagged" with any number of tags as long as they are from unique tag types.
