A **deployment** is a set of config instances made available on a particular [device](/docs/home/basics/vocabulary#device). 

Deployments are associated with a particular [release](/docs/home/basics/vocabulary#release) and must satisfy that release's constraints. Specifically, a deployment must have exactly one config instance that satisfies every config schema in its associated release.

While config instances are used to define a set of parameters for a particular part of your application, deployments are used to define all the parameters for your application.
