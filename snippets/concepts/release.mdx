A **release** represents the version of a robot's software. In Miru, a release defines a set of config schemas used to validate configurations for a given software version.

So, a config schema defines the configuration constraints for an aspect of the robot's software. A release then uses a set of config schemas to define the configuration constraints for all of the robot's software.
