A **release** is a version of software.

Amongst a fleet of robots, several software versions may deployed at any given time. This makes managing configurations, which the software relies on, a critical challenge. Releases are used to manage this complexity.

A release contains a set of config schemas that define the valid config instances for a given version of software. Say our software application `v1.7.0` requires a config instance for three different config types: 
1. Mobility
1. Perception
1. Manipulation

Release `v1.7.0` in Miru would then define a config schema for each of the required config types:
1. Mobility - schema `v1.2`
1. Perception - schema `v1.3`
1. Manipulation - schema `v1.1`

Before deploying config instances to a robot, the robot's current release (`v1.7.0`) is used to validate all config instances are present and satisfy the release's config schemas.
