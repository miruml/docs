A **release** is a version of software and its compatible config schemas.

Amongst a fleet of robots, multiple software versions may be deployed. Each release defines which config schema versions are valid for that software version.

For example, software release `v1.7.0` might specify the following schema versions.

| **Config Type** | **Schema Version** |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `Mobility`       | `v1.2`            |
| `Perception`   | `v1.3`            |
| `Manipulation` | `v1.1`            |

Before deploying config instances, the robot's current release (`v1.7.0`) is used to validate that all config instances are present and satisfy the release's config schemas.
