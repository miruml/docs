Tags and tag types are used to group devices by some criteria. Formally, a **tag type** is a group of related tags, while a **tag** is an instantiation of a tag type.

Examples illustrate this best:

A `hardware` tag type could be used to group devices by their compute type and generation:

- `Raspberry Pi 4 Model B`
- `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano`
- `NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX`

An `environment` tag type could be used to group devices by their usage in different stages of development:

- `Development`
- `QA`
- `Beta`
- `Stable`

A `region` tag type could be used to group devices by the region they are deployed to:

- `east`
- `west`
- `central`

Tag types and tags are defined by you, allowing you to tailor tags them to your application's needs.

Devices may be "tagged" with any number of tags as long as they are from unique tag types.
