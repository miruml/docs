A **tag type** is a container for a group of related **tags**, which are used to group devices by some criteria.

To illustrate this, the following are possible tag types and their associated tags.

| Tag Type | Tags |
|----------|------|
| `hardware` | `Raspberry Pi`, `NVIDIA Jetson` |
| `environment` | `Development`, `QA`, `Beta`, `Stable` |
| `region` | `east`, `west`, `central` |

Tag types and tags are defined by you, allowing you to tailor tags them to your application's needs.
