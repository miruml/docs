A **config instance** is a config whose parameters have specific values for a device, environment, or version.

Config instances are typically stored as JSON or YAML files (or even in a database), which applications parse into a structured format for consumption. The following YAML file defines a config instance for controlling a robotâ€™s motion.
```yaml
max_linear_speed_mps: 1.2
max_angular_speed_radps: 1.0
obstacle_avoidance_enabled: true
navigation_mode: balanced
telemetry:
  upload_interval_sec: 60
  heartbeat_interval_sec: 10
```
