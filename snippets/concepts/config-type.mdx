A **config type** is a container for all config schemas and config instances that configure an aspect of a robot's software.

For instance, a robot may use a `Mobility` config type to configure motion parameters. The `Mobility` config type contains config schemas that undergo frequent updates — new fields are introduced, constraints are modified, and existing fields are deprecated.

The Mobility config type also contains config instances, each of which satisfies one of its config schema versions. These config instances have a history for each robot--parameters are added, many are modified, and some are removed.

Config types let you isolate and version subsets of parameters so they can be updated and managed separately from the rest of your system.
