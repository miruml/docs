A **config type** represents the parameters that configure an aspect of a robot's software, regardless of the version of that software.

For instance, a robot may have a `Mobility` config type that configures its motion. The `Mobility` config type goes through many iterations--parameters are added or deprecated (creating new config schemas) and given different values (creating new config instances).

The `Mobility` config type is not a particular config instance nor a particular config schema. It simply refers to the motion-related parameters for the robot in general.
