A **config type** is the superset of all config schemas and config instances that configure a particular aspect of a robot's software.

For instance, a robot may have a `Mobility` config type that configures motion parameters. The `Mobility` config type has schemas which go through many versions--fields are added, constraints are modified, and fields are removed. Config instances which satisfy those schemas then go through their own iterations for each robot--parameters are added, many are modified, some are removed, etc..

Thus, the `Mobility` config type is not a particular config instance nor a particular config schema. It simply refers to the motion-related parameters for the robot in general.
