A **config type** is responsible for a logical group of parameters used by your robot's software. Config types are composed of schemas (which define structure and constraints) and instances (which hold actual configuration values).

For example, a `Mobility` config type contains schemas and instances related to the robot's motion, while a `Safety Features` config type contains the schemas and instances related to the robot's safety. All schemas and instances belong to exactly one config type, allowing you to version and manage different aspects of your configurations independently.
