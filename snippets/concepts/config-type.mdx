A **config type** represents a category of config that governs a specific aspect of your robot's application, such as mobility, perception, or manipulation.
Each config type contains:
- **Schemas:** defining the structure and constraints for that type’s config.
- **Instances:** concrete configs that conform to one of its schema versions.

Config types evolve over time as the application changes. Let’s take the example of a `Mobility` config type.

Across schema versions, the config type might introduce new motion parameters, deprecate old ones, or modify constraints. Each robot will also have its own history of Mobility config instances, allowing the parameters to evolve independently from the schemas.

Config types let you isolate and version subsets of parameters so they can be updated and managed separately from the rest of your system.
