A **config type** is a container for all config schemas and config instances that configure an aspect of a robot's software.

For instance, a robot may use a Mobility config type to configure motion parameters. The Mobility config type contains config schemas which go through many versions--new fields are available, constraints are modified, and fields are deprecated. 

The Mobility config type also contains config instances, each of which satisfies one of its config schema versions. These config instances have a history for each robot--parameters are added, many are modified, and some are removed.

The Mobility config type is useful for managing a subset of parameters for your robots, which may be updated independently of other parameters.
