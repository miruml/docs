A **deployment** is a set of one or more config instances made available on a device.

Config instances are deployed by the [Miru Agent](/docs/home/agent/intro), which writes the config instances to a subdirectory of the `/srv/miru/config_instances` directory on the target device.

Deployments are the "glue" that tie together config instances, releases, and devices to provide a structured way to manage configurations. As such, the following constraints are useful to understand what a deployment is:

1. A deployment's config instances are immutable. 

    Once created, the config instances of a deployment cannot be updated. A new deployment must be created to modify a device's config instances.

1. Deployments belong to a single release.

    Deployments use their release's config schemas to validate the config instances they contain.

1. Deployments are associated with a single device. 

    Deploying to two different devices requires a deployment for each device. 

1. Deployments are one-time use. 

    Once removed from a device, a new deployment must be created to restore a device's previous configurations.
