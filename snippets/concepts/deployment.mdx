A **deployment** is a set of config instances made available on a device.

Config instances are deployed by the [Miru Agent](/docs/home/agent/intro), which writes the config instances to a subdirectory of the `/srv/miru/config_instances` directory on the target device.

Deployments tie together **config instances**, **releases**, and **devices**, ensuring that every device runs a valid config instance for its software version.

The following constraints are useful to understand what a deployment is:
1. **A deployment's config instances are immutable.**

   Once created, the config instances of a deployment cannot be updated. A new deployment must be created to modify a device's config instances.
1. **Deployments belong to a single release.**

   Deployments use their release's config schemas to validate the config instances they contain.
1. **Deployments are associated with a single device.**

   Deploying to two different devices requires a deployment for each device.
1. **Deployments are one-time use.**

   Once removed from a device, a new deployment must be created to restore a device's previous configurations.
