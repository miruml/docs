A **deployment** is a set of config instances made available on a device for some interval of time.

A deployment adheres to a release and must satisfy that release's constraints: it must have a valid config instance for each config schema in the release.

So, a config instance contains parameters for part of the robot's software. A deployment then uses a set of config instances to define the parameters for all of the robot's software.
