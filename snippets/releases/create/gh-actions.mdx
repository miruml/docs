The following GitHub Actions workflow creates a release when a tag is pushed to the repository. 

The pushed tag is used as the release's `version`. 

The `--schemas` flag is used to specify the directory containing the schemas to include in the release. However, you can also specify schemas as individual files by using the `--schema` flag. Checkout the [CLI Reference](/docs/references/cli/release-create) for more information.

To use the workflow, place it in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/create-miru-release.yml`).

```yaml .github/workflows/create-miru-release.yml
name: Create Miru Release

on:
  push:
    tags: 
      - '*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: Setup Miru CLI
        uses: mirurobotics/setup-miru@v0.1
        with:
          version: 'v0.9'

      - name: Create the release
        env:
          MIRU_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MIRU_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          miru release create \
            --version "${{ github.ref_name }}" \
            --schemas ./schemas
```
