A **release** is a version of software and its compatible config schemas.

Amongst a fleet of robots, multiple software versions may be deployed. Each release defines which config schema versions are valid for that software version.

For example, software release `v1.7.0` might specify the following schemas.

| **Config Type** | **Schema Version** |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `Mobility`       | **SCH-FmoDN** |
| `Perception`   | **SCH-3JcLq** |
| `Manipulation` | **SCH-HHDRn** |

Before deploying config instances to a device, the deployment's release (`v1.7.0`) is used to validate that it contains all necessary config instances and that each instance satisfies the release's schemas.
