A **release** is a version of software and its compatible config schemas.

Within a fleet of robots, multiple software versions may be deployed -- each release defines which config schemas are valid for that version.

For example, software release `v1.7.0` might specify the following schemas:

| **Config Type** | **Schema Version** |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| `Mobility`      | **SCH-FmoDN**      |
| `Perception`    | **SCH-3JcLq**      |
| `Manipulation`  | **SCH-HHDRn**      |

Before deploying config instances to a device, the deployment's release (`v1.7.0`) is used to verify that all required config instances are present and that each instance complies with the release's schemas.
