A **tag type** is a container for a set of related **tags** used to group devices by criteria.

To illustrate this, the following tag types and their associated tags are shown.

| Tag Type      | Tags                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `hardware`    | `Raspberry Pi`, `NVIDIA Jetson`       |
| `environment` | `Development`, `QA`, `Beta`, `Stable` |
| `region`      | `east`, `west`, `central`             |

Tag types and tags are defined by you, allowing you to tailor them to your application's needs.
