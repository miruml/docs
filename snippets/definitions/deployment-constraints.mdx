Deployments have a variety of constraints designed to simplify configuration updates:

1. **A deployment's config instances are immutable**

   Once created, the configs in a deployment cannot be updated. A new deployment must be created to modify a device's configs.
1. **Deployments belong to a single release**

   Deployments belong to exactly one release, whose config schemas are used to validate the configurations in the deployment.
1. **Deployments belong to a single device**

   Deploying the same configs to two devices requires a deployment for each device.
1. **Deployments are one-time use**

   Once removed from a device, a new deployment must be created to restore a device's previous configurations.
