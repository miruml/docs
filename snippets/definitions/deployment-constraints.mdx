Deployments have a variety of constraints designed to simplify configuration updates:

1. **A deployment's config instances are immutable**

   Once created, the config instances of a deployment cannot be updated. A new deployment must be created to modify a device's config instances.

1. **Deployments belong to a single release**

   Deployments use their release's config schemas to validate the config instances they contain.

1. **Deployments belong to a single device**

   Deploying to two different devices requires a deployment for each device.

1. **Deployments are one-time use**

   Once removed from a device, a new deployment must be created to restore a device's previous configurations.
