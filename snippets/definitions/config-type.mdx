A **config type** represents a logical grouping of parameters used by your robot's software. It consists of

1. The config instances in its domain (the actual parameters deployed to devices)
2. A versioned config schema, which defines the structure and constraints for those instances

For example, a `Mobility` config type houses configs related to the robot's motion while a `Safety Features` config type houses configs related to the robot's safety. Each config type has its own versioned schema, which its config instances must adhere to depending on the release they are deployed under.
