A **config type** represents a logical grouping of parameters used by your robot's software. Config types consist of config schemas, which define the structure and constraints, and config instances, which store the actual configuration values.

For example, a `Mobility` config type contains schemas and configs related to the robot's motion, while a `Safety Features` config type contains the schemas and configs related to the robot's safety. All schemas and configs belong to exactly one config type, allowing you to version and manage different aspects of your application's configuration independently.
