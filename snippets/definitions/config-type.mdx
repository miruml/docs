A **config type** is responsible for a logical group of parameters used by your robot's software. Config types are composed of config schemas (which define structure and constraints) and config instances (which hold actual configuration values).

For example, a `Mobility` config type contains schemas and configs related to the robot's motion, while a `Safety Features` config type contains the schemas and configs related to the robot's safety. All schemas and configs belong to exactly one config type, allowing you to version and manage different aspects of your application's configuration independently.
