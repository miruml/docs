A **device** is the machine to which config instances are deployed. This could be an NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, industrial PC, or any other computer running your robot's application.

Configurations are deployed to devices via the [Miru Agent](/docs/agent/intro), a lightweight `systemd` service that syncs configurations from the cloud to the device's local filesystem in real-time.
