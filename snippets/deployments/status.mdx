The status is a merged property of the `activity status` and `error status` fields, with error states taking precedence over activity states when errors are present.

So, if the error status is `none`, then the status is simply the activity status. If the error status is not `none`, then the status is the error status.

Below are some examples of the status given different activity and error states.

| Activity Status | Error Status | Status |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| `staged`       | `none`       | `staged` |
| `deployed`      | `none`       | `deployed` |
| `queued`        | `retrying`   | `retrying` |
| `removed`       | `failed`     | `failed` |
