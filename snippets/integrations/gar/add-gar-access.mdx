To grant a service account access to repositories in your Artifact Registry, navigate to the [Artifact Registry Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/artifacts) in Google Cloud Console and select the same Google Cloud project as the service account you connected to `miru` with. For us that's **container-integration**.

Select the repository you want to grant your service account access to. We've selected the **django** repository. Then click the **Add Principal** button.

Open a new tab in the [Service Accounts Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts), find the service account you connected to `miru` with, and copy the email address listed.

Navigate back to the [Artifact Registry Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/artifacts) and paste the service account email address into the **New Principals** field. Then add the **Artifact Registry Reader** role to the service account and click **Save**.

You should now see your service account listed with the **Artifact Registry Reader** role for the repository you selected. To grant `miru` access to more repositories, simply repeat the process for each repository.

Congratulations! You've successfully connected `miru` to a Google Artifact Registry repository. `miru` will have read-only access to selected repositories in your Artifact Registry. If you want to add repositories from a different Google Cloud project, please create a separate service account for that project, add it to `miru`, and grant access to the chosen repositories. 

To use an image from your Google Artifact repository, simply specify the image reference in your **docker-compose.yml** file.

```yaml
<compose-service>:
    image: <region>-docker.pkg.dev/<google-cloud-project>/<repository>/<image>:<tag>
```

For instance, adding an image from our **django** repository looks like this:

```yaml
<compose-service>:
    image: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/container-integration/django/backend:latest
```
