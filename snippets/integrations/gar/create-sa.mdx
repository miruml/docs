Navigate to the [service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page in your Google Cloud Console. Select the Google Cloud project that you want to connect `miru` to. We're using **container-integration**.

<Note> To connect multiple Google Cloud projects, you will need to create a separate service account for each project you want to connect to `miru`. </Note>

Click the **Create Service Account** button to create a new service account for this Google Cloud Project.

Fill in the service account name and description before clicking **Create and Continue**. You can follow the naming convention we've used or choose your own.

Search for the **Service Account Token Creator** role and add it to the service account. This will allow `miru` to create temporary tokens with the same permissions as the service account itself, allowing temporary (1 hour long) tokens to be distributed to your devices for authenticating to Google Artifact Registry.

<Warning> For the **Service Account Token Creator Role** to work properly, please ensure that the [IAM Service Account Credentials API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com) is enabled for your Google Cloud project by clicking [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com) (double check the selected Google Cloud Project) and selecting the **Enable** button. </Warning>

Click **Continue** to update the service account policies.

Finally, click **Done** to create the service account. 

For now this service account has no permissions to access any of your Google Cloud resources. We'll later grant it access to your chosen Artifact Registry repositories in [Grant Access to Artifact Registry Repositories](http://docs.miruml.com/pages/integrations/gar#grant-access-to-artifact-registry-repositories).
