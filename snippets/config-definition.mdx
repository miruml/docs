In Miru a **config** represents the parameters responsible for configuring a particular aspect of your application *through time*. For instance, your application may have a "motion control" config which is responsible for controlling the motion of your robot. The motion control config goes through many iterations--parameters are added or deprecated (creating new config schemas for the config) and given different values (creating new concrete configs for the config). The motion control config is not a particular instatiation of parameters nor is it a particular specification of constraints. Instead it is the parameters which are responsible for configuring the motion of your robot at any point in your application's lifecycle.
