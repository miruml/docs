A **Config** represents the parameters responsible for configuring a particular aspect of your application through time.

For instance, your application may have a `motion_control_config` that controls the motion of your robot. The `motion_control_config` goes through many iterations—parameters are added or deprecated (creating new **Config Schemas** for the **Config**) and given different values (creating new **Concrete Configs** for the **Config**).

The `motion_control_config` is not a particular instantiation of parameters or a particular specification of constraints. Instead, it is the parameters responsible for configuring the motion of your robot at any point in your application’s lifecycle.
