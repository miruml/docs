A **config** represents the parameters responsible for configuring a particular aspect of your application *through time*. 

For instance, your application may have a "motion control" config that controls the motion of your robot. The motion control config goes through many iterations--parameters are added or deprecated (creating new config schemas for the config) and given different values (creating new concrete configs for the config). 

The motion control config is not a particular instantiation of parameters or a particular specification of constraints. Instead, it is the parameters responsible for configuring the motion of your robot at any point in your application's lifecycle.
