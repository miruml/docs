A **policy** is a set of **overrides** which hierarchically evaluate to a concrete config. Policies have two components:
1. A policy schema
2. A hierarchical set of overrides

When deploying a concrete config to a client, the concrete config must adhere to a particular config schema. In Miru, this config schema refers to a policy that evaluates the client's tags to determine the unique concrete config for deployment. 

Below you can see that the config schema `v8` of the Motion Control config is using the `v4` Policy.
