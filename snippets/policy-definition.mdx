A **policy** is a set of **overrides** that hierarchically evaluate to a concrete config. Policies have two components:
1. A policy schema
2. A hierarchical set of overrides

When deploying a concrete config to a client, it must adhere to a particular config schema. Config schemas refer to a policy that evaluates the client's tags to determine the unique concrete config for deployment. 

As an example, the config schema `v8` of the Motion Control config uses the `v4` Policy.
