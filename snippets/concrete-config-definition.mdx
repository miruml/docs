A **concrete config** is a particular instantiation of parameters used to alter the behavior of your code. 

You're probably storing concrete configs as JSON or YAML files (or potentially in a database somewhere), which your application parses into a structured format for consumption.

The following YAML file defines a concrete config for controlling a robot's motion.
