The second part of a policy is its overrides. An **override** references tag metadata that "overrides" the current evaluation of a policy. Here is a `hardware` override example.

The default values in our policy schema are shown on the left. On the right is our hardware override, which references the `supports_jump`, `supports_spin`, and `supports_backflip` fields in the metadata schema for the `hardware` tag type. 

An override does not need to specify all the fields in a policy schema, only a subset of the policy schema fields. However, it cannot specify fields not present in the policy schema.

Given a particular tag, we'd be able to evaluate the metadata values for the `supports_jump`, `supports_spin`, and `supports_backflip` in the hardware override to specific values. Given the `NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano` tag, our hardware override would use `features.jump: true`, `features.spin: true`, and `features.backflip: false`. This would override the default values in the policy schema, changing `features.spin` from `false` to `true`.

Overrides are hierarchically chained to define a policy's evaluation of a concrete config for a client. The client's tags determine the specific values referenced by an override.

By combining tags with overrides, policies grant a concise yet flexible way to deploy different configurations to each of your clients.
