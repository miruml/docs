The provision script supports the following parameters to tune your installation.

For example, you may want to provide the device name or hardset the version of the agent to install.

<ParamField path="--device-name" type="string" default="$HOSTNAME">
The name of the device in the Miru dashboard.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--allow-reactivation" type="boolean" default={false}>
Allows reactivation of existing devices. Without this flag, only `inactive` devices can be activated. With this flag, devices which have been previously activated (status `online`, `offline`, etc.) may be reactivated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--version" type="string">
Specific agent version to install (e.g., `v0.6.0`). Defaults to the [latest release](https://github.com/miruml/agent/releases/latest). See all [available versions](https://github.com/miruml/agent/releases).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--from-pkg" type="string">
The file path to the Miru Agent debian package to use for installation. Useful for installing the agent in [poor connectivity scenarios](/docs/home/agent/install/poor-connectivity).
