Upon successful installation, you'll see a confirmation message in the terminal.

```bash
==> Successfully activated this device as ArcticBlaze!
```

Navigating back to the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices), you should see your device listed with the status `Activating` before transitioning to `Online`.

<Info>
  The transition from `Activating` to `Online` typically takes 5-15 seconds, depending on your network connection.
