Upon successful installation, you'll see a confirmation message in the terminal.

```bash
==> Successfully activated this device as Robot A!
```

Navigate back to the [Devices page](https://configs.miruml.com/devices) to verify the installation. Your device will briefly be `Activating` before transitioning to `Online`.

<Info>
The transition from `Activating` to `Online` typically takes 5-15 seconds depending on your network connection.
