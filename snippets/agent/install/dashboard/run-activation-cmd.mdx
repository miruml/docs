Open a terminal on the device where you want to install the Miru Agent and paste the installation command.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** `curl` must be installed and you need `sudo` privileges on the target device.
</Info>

The installation command is composed of several parts:

- `curl -fsSL <installation-script-url>` - downloads the installation script from the [Miru Agent repository](https://github.com/miruml/agent)
- `|` - pipes the downloaded script to the shell
- `env MIRU_ACTIVATION_TOKEN=<activation-token>` - sets the activation token environment variable
- `sh` - executes the script with the token

<Tip>
You can review the installation script source code [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/install.sh) before running it.
</Tip>

Executing the installation script performs the following actions.

1. **Downloads the agent** - fetches the latest Miru Agent debian package
1. **Installs the service** - installs the agent as a `systemd` service
1. **Activates the device** - registers the agent with Miru servers using the activation token
