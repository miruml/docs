<Note>
`curl` must be installed and sudo privileges are required. 
</Note>

The installation command is composed of the following parts:

- `curl -fsSL <installation-script-url>` downloads the installation script from the [Miru Agent repository](https://github.com/miruml/agent).
- `|` pipes the script to the shell.
- `env MIRU_ACTIVATION_TOKEN=<activation-token>` sets the activation token environment variable.
- `<activation-token>` is a short-lived token used to identify and activate the device.
- `sh` executes the script.

You can review the contents of the installation script [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/install.sh). 

The script downloads the Miru Agent, installs the agent as a `systemd` service, and activates the agent using the provided token.

Upon successful installation, a message will confirm that the device has been activated.

```bash
==> Successfully activated this device as Robot A!
```

To verify the installation, navigate back to the [Devices page](https://configs.miruml.com/devices). The device will briefly show as `Activating` before transitioning to `Online` once connected to the server.
