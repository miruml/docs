<Note>
`curl` must be installed and sudo privileges may be required. 
</Note>

The installation command is composed of the following parts:

- `curl -fsSL <installation-script-url>` downloads the installation script from the Miru Agent repository.
- `|` pipes the script to the shell.
- `env MIRU_ACTIVATION_TOKEN=<activation-token>` sets the activation token environment variable.
- `sh` executes the script.

You can review the contents of the [installation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/deb-install.sh) and [activation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/activate.sh) scripts [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent/tree/main/scripts/install).

The script first downloads the Miru Agent debian package and installs the agent as a `systemd` service. Next it downloads the activation script and activates the agent.

Upon successful installation, a message will confirm that the agent has been activated.

```bash
Successfully activated the miru agent as the Robot A device!
```

Navigating back to the [Devices page](https://configs.miruml.com/devices) will show the device as `Online`.
