Run the following installation command in your terminal.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/manual-install.sh | sh
```

The script requires `curl` to be installed and sudo privileges may be required. 

Review the contents of the [installation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/manual-deb-install.sh) and [activation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/activate.sh) scripts [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent).

The script downloads the Miru agent debian package and installs the agent as a `systemd` service. It then downloads and executes the activation script, waiting for a client activation token to be provided.

To retrieve a client activation token, navigate to the [Clients page](https://configs.miruml.com/clients) and click the ellipses (three dots) to the right of the client to activate.

</Frame>

Click the `Token` tab and copy the token.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/getting-started/client-activation-token.png" />
</Frame>

Paste the token into the activation script.

```bash
To authenticate the miru agent, you'll need to retrieve the authentication token from https://configs.miruml.com/clients for the client you want to authenticate as.

 Enter Authentication Token â€º *******
```

A message will confirm that the agent has been activated for the specified client.

```bash
Successfully activated the miru agent as the Robot 1 client!
