Run the following installation command in your terminal.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/manual-install.sh | sh
```

The script requires `curl` to be installed and sudo privileges may be required. 

Review the contents of the [installation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/manual-deb-install.sh) and [activation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/activate.sh) scripts [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent/tree/main/scripts/install).

The script downloads the Miru agent debian package and installs the agent as a `systemd` service. It then downloads and executes the activation script, waiting for a device activation token to be provided.

To retrieve a device activation token, navigate to the [Devices page](https://configs.miruml.com/devices) and click the ellipses (three dots) to the right of the device to activate.

</Frame>

Click the `Token` tab and copy the token.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/getting-started/device-activation-token.png" />
</Frame>

Paste the token into the activation script.

```bash
To authenticate the miru agent, you'll need to retrieve the authentication token from https://configs.miruml.com/devices for the device you want to authenticate as.

 Enter Authentication Token â€º *******
```

A message will confirm that the agent has been activated for the specified device.

```bash
Successfully activated the miru agent as the Robot 1 device!
