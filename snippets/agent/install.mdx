Run the following installation command in your terminal.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/install.sh | sh
```

The script requires `curl` to be installed and sudo privileges may be required. 

Review the contents of the [installation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/deb-install.sh) and [activation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/activate.sh) scripts [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent/tree/main/scripts/install).

The script downloads the Miru agent debian package and installs the agent as a `systemd` service. It then downloads and executes the activation script, waiting for a device activation token to be provided.

## Activation

To retrieve a device activation token, navigate to the 
[Devices page](https://configs.miruml.com/devices) and 
click the ellipses (three dots) to the right of the device to activate.

</Frame>

Click the `Token` tab and copy the token.

<Frame>
   ![](/images/getting-started/device-activation-token.png)
</Frame>

Paste the token into the activation script.

```bash
To authenticate the miru agent, you'll need to retrieve the authentication token from https://configs.miruml.com/devices for the device you want to authenticate as.

 Enter Authentication Token â€º *******
```

A message will confirm that the agent has been activated for the specified device.

```bash
Successfully activated the miru agent as the Robot A device!
```

## Socket Permissions

The Miru agent serves requests over the unix socket `/run/miru/miru.sock`, which is created with the `miru:miru` permissions (user `miru` and group `miru`). 

Any access to the socket must executed with a user that is a member of the `miru` group. To add a user to the `miru` group, run

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G miru <username>
```

To add the current user to the `miru` group, run

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G miru $USER
```

<Warning>
You must log out of your desktop or SSH session and log back in for group changes to take effect permanently.
</Warning>

To temporarily run the current shell session as a member of the `miru` group, run

```bash
newgrp miru
```

Any new shell sessions will require you to run `newgrp miru` again until you've logged out of your desktop or SSH session and logged back in.
