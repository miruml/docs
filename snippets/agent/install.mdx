Run the following installation command in your terminal.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/install.sh | sh
```

The script requires `curl` to be installed and sudo privileges may be required. 

Review the contents of the [installation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/deb-install.sh) and [activation](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/activate.sh) scripts [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent/tree/main/scripts/install).

The script downloads the Miru agent debian package and installs the agent as a `systemd` service. It then downloads and executes the activation script, waiting for a device activation token to be provided.
