The Miru agent serves API requests over the Unix socket `/run/miru/miru.sock`, which is created with the `root:miru` permissions (user `root` and group `miru`). 

Any access to the socket must be executed with a user that is a member of the `miru` group. 

<Note>
Access to the socket is granted to the `root` user but this is not recommended for security best practices.
</Note>

To add a user to the `miru` group, run

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G miru <username>
```

To add the current user to the `miru` group, run

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G miru $USER
```

<Warning>
You must log out of your desktop or SSH session and log back in for group changes to take effect permanently.
</Warning>

To temporarily run the current shell session as a member of the `miru` group, run

```bash
newgrp miru
```

Any new shell sessions will require you to run `newgrp miru` again until you've logged out of your desktop or SSH session and logged back in.
