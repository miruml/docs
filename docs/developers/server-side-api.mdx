Miru's Server-Side API is a REST API for programmatically managing your Miru resources. 

The Server-Side API is primarily for backend and cloud-native applications, allowing you to build custom workflows for provisioning devices, CI/CD pipelines, and more.

The Server-Side API is distinct from the [Agent-Side API](/docs/developers/agent-side-api), which is a REST API exposed by the Miru Agent for programmatic control by applications *running on your devices*. 

While the Server-Side API is accessed over the internet, the Agent-Side API is only available on devices running the Miru Agent and does not require internet access for operation. For more information on the Agent-Side API, visit the [Agent-Side API](/docs/developers/agent-side-api) section.
