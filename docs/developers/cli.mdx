The Miru Command Line Interface (CLI) is for defining and uploading config schemas to Miru. The CLI is also a convenient tool for managing Miru resources in your local environment instead of using the web interface.

The CLI does NOT talk to the Miru Agent and should not be used on devices running the Miru Agent. The CLI should only be installed and used on your development machine.

For a complete list of commands and flags, see the [CLI Reference](/docs/references/cli/install) section.
