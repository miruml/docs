title: "Agent-Side API"
---

Miru's Agent-Side API is a REST API for programmatically interacting with the Miru Agent via an application running on your device. The Agent-Side API is not available over the internet and is only accessible on devices running the Miru Agent.

The Agent-Side API is useful for tasks such as manually refreshing configurations, retrieving current configurations, and checking agent status directly from applications running on the device.

The Agent-Side API is distinct from the [Server-Side API](/docs/developers/server-side-api), which is REST API for backend services and CI/CD pipelines to manage Miru resources. For more information on the Server-Side API, visit the [Server-Side API](/docs/developers/server-side-api) section.
