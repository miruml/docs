Miru supports continuous integration (CI) to automate various tasks, such as the creation of [releases](/docs/learn/releases/create) and their associated schemas.

CI pipelines leverage the [Miru CLI](/docs/references/cli/intro) to programmatically execute any CLI commands, which accepts API keys for authentication. 

Since the Miru CLI is the engine behind CI tasks, any tasks supported by the CLI can easily be automated in your CI pipeline.

## Supported CI tools

Currently, GitHub Actions is the only officially supported CI tool. However, support for other CI tools is coming soon.

If you use a different CI tool, please reach out to [support@mirurobotics.com](mailto:support@mirurobotics.com) to request support for your tool.

## Authentication

The CLI can be authenticated using an API key. Simply export the `MIRU_API_KEY` environment variable in your CI pipeline for the CLI to use.

```bash
export MIRU_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

To create an API key, follow the instructions below.

<CreateAPIKey />

To determine the scopes to give the API key, consult the documentation for the task you want to automate. For example, if you want to create a release, see the [create release](/docs/learn/releases/create) documentation for the required scopes.
