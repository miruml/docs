    ## Workspace Logo

    You can now personalize your workspace with a team logo and add a profile picture 
    to your account. We’ve also added a new feedback form in the app so you can easily 
    share your thoughts or report bugs.

    ### Upload a workspace logo

    Admins and owners can now upload a custom logo for their workspace. Once set, the 
    logo is displayed in the sidebar and invite pages, giving new members a branded 
    welcome experience.

    ### Upload a profile picture

    Make your profile your own. Go to **Settings → Profile** to upload a profile 
    picture. We've included a built-in cropper so you can center your image 
    perfectly before saving.

    />

    ### Give feedback in the app

    We’ve added a dedicated feedback button directly in the sidebar so you can share 
    your thoughts without leaving your workflow.

    Use the feedback form to share:
    - **Feedback** — feature requests, suggestions, or general thoughts
    - **Bug Report** — issues you encounter while using the app

    We take bugs seriously. Our commitment to you:
    - **All reported bugs** are resolved within **7 days**
    - **Critical bugs** are resolved within **2 days**

            **OTP Email Authentication:** Replaced magic links with a 6-digit

            **Removed Schema Versioning:** We've replaced schema version numbers with

            we removed the extra tracking layer in Miru.

            schema and cannot be overridden during deployment.

            code execution.

    ## CUE Support

    We are excited to announce full support for CUE (Configure, Unify, Execute) 
    as a first-class schema language in Miru. You can now define config schemas in 
    CUE, version them in Git, and push them via the Miru CLI to validate config 
    instances before deployment.

    ### Uploading a CUE schema

    Pushing a CUE schema to Miru follows the same Git-integrated workflow you are used 
    to. Simply define your schema in a `.cue` file and use the Miru CLI to push it.

    />

    ### Managing CUE schemas

    Once uploaded, your CUE schemas appear in the dashboard where you can view the raw 
    content (preserving comments and formatting) and associated metadata.

    Management works just like existing schemas: most properties are immutable, though 
    you can update the config instance deployment path. Deletion is only permitted 
    for schemas with no active config instances.

    ## Workspace Invitations

    You can now invite team members to your workspace and manage their roles. This 
    release also adds new workspace and profile settings.

    ### Inviting team members

    Onboard your team directly from the dashboard. Navigate to **Settings > Members** 
    and click the **Invite** button.

    Once you enter their email and select a role, they will receive an email with 
    a link to join your workspace.

    - **New users** will be guided to sign up and then prompted to accept the invitation.
    - **Existing users** can accept the invite via the email link or their Profile settings 
    page.

    />

    ### Manage roles and access

    We have introduced three distinct user roles:

    - **Owner** — Full control over the workspace (limit one per workspace).
    - **Admin** — Administrative access to manage members and workspace settings.
    - **Member** — Application access without administrative privileges.

    Admins and owners can manage members: update roles, edit names, suspend users, 
    resend or revoke invites, and reinvite suspended/left users.

    ### Profile and workspace settings

    Manage your profile and workspace details from dedicated settings pages.

    - **Profile** — Update your name, view pending invites, or leave your workspace.
    - **Workspace** — Admins and owners can update the workspace name.

            **Release Overview:** We added a dedicated overview page for each release. 
            This includes the total count of staged deployments and the total number of 
            deployments created for that release, alongside the defined config schemas.

    ## Device Releases

    You can now set and change a device's release directly from the device page, 
    eliminating the need to navigate to the releases page for single-device operations.


    ### Setting the initial release

    After activating a device, you'll be prompted to set its initial release before 
    accessing the config editor. This two-step process requires:
    
    1. **Select a release** - Choose which software version this device will run
    2. **Deploy configurations** - Create a new deployment or deploy a staged deployment

    />


    ### Changing the release

    The device's current release is now visible in the editor (left sidebar). Click the 
    release to open a dropdown and select a different release version. 
    
    When changing releases, you’ll need to deploy a new set of configurations — either 
    select a staged deployment or create a new deployment.
