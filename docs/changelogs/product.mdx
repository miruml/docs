    ## CUE Support

    We are excited to announce full support for CUE (Configure, Unify, Execute) 
    as a first-class schema language in Miru. You can now define config schemas in 
    CUE, version them in Git, and push them via the Miru CLI to validate config 
    instances before deployment.

    ### Uploading a CUE schema

    Pushing a CUE schema to Miru follows the same Git-integrated workflow you are used 
    to. Simply define your schema in a `.cue` file and use the Miru CLI to push it.

    />

    ### Managing CUE schemas

    Once uploaded, your CUE schemas appear in the dashboard where you can view the raw 
    content (preserving comments and formatting) and associated metadata.

    Management works just like existing schemas: most properties are immutable, though 
    you can update the config instance deployment path. Deletion is only permitted 
    for schemas with no active config instances.

    ## Workspace Invitations

    You can now invite team members to your workspace and manage their roles. This 
    release also adds new workspace and profile settings.

    ### Inviting team members

    Onboard your team directly from the dashboard. Navigate to **Settings > Members** 
    and click the **Invite** button.

    Once you enter their email and select a role, they will receive an email with 
    a link to join your workspace.

    - **New users** will be guided to sign up and then prompted to accept the invitation.
    - **Existing users** can accept the invite via the email link or their Profile settings 
    page.

    />

    ### Manage roles and access

    We have introduced three distinct user roles:

    - **Owner** — Full control over the workspace (limit one per workspace).
    - **Admin** — Administrative access to manage members and workspace settings.
    - **Member** — Application access without administrative privileges.

    Admins and owners can manage members: update roles, edit names, suspend users, 
    resend or revoke invites, and reinvite suspended/left users.

    />

    ### Profile and workspace settings

    Manage your profile and workspace details from dedicated settings pages.

    - **Profile** — Update your name, view pending invites, or leave your workspace.
    - **Workspace** — Admins and owners can update the workspace name.

            **Release Overview:** We added a dedicated overview page for each release. 
            This includes the total count of staged deployments and the total number of 
            deployments created for that release, alongside the defined config schemas.

            **Consolidated Page Header:** To maximize screen space, we have collapsed 
            the page breadcrumb and title headers into a single, unified line across 
            key pages like Devices, Releases, and Configs.

        <DropdownItem>
            **Faster Navigation:** Navigation between Release sub-pages is now 
            significantly smoother due to data prefetching that automatically loads 
            the next page's data when you hover over navigation links.

            or editing Tags, Config Types, and Config Schemas. Previously, pressing 
            Enter would accidentally close the form and discard your progress.

            **Editor:** Switching releases in the editor no longer incorrectly displays 
            stale config types from the previous release that are not valid for the 
            new release.

    ## Device Releases

    You can now set and change a device's release directly from the device page, 
    eliminating the need to navigate to the releases page for single-device operations.


    ### Setting the initial release

    After activating a device, you'll be prompted to set its initial release before 
    accessing the config editor. This two-step process requires:
    
    1. **Select a release** - Choose which software version this device will run
    2. **Deploy configurations** - Create a new deployment or deploy a staged deployment

        src="https://assets.miruml.com/docs/changelog/25-11-10/setting-init-release.mp4"
    />


    ### Changing the release

    The device's current release is now visible in the editor (left sidebar). Click the 
    release to open a dropdown and select a different release version. 
    
    When changing releases, you’ll need to deploy a new set of configurations — either 
    select a staged deployment or create a new deployment.
