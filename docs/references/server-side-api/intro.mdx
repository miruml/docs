The Miru Server-Side API is a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) API that allows you to programmatically manage your Miru resources, useful for provisioning devices, deploying configurations, and more.

To get started, continue to the [Authentication](/docs/references/server-side-api/authn) page to learn how to authenticate your requests. Then, explore the basics of the Server-Side API by reading through the [Query Parameters](/docs/references/server-side-api/query-params/filtering) section.

For information about a specific API endpoint, visit the [**Endpoints**](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/config-instances/get) section.
