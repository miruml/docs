## API keys
The Miru API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Miru Dashboard](https://configs.miruml.com/secrets/api-keys).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

To authenticate, include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of your request:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

All requests must be made over HTTPS. Any requests over plain HTTP or without authentication will fail.
