title: "Filtering"

All list endpoints in the Miru API support filtering to help you retrieve specific resources.

For example, when [listing devices](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/devices/list), you can filter by `id`, `name`, and other fields.



## Single Value Filters

Each list endpoint supports its own set of filter names. To see the filters supported by a specific endpoint, look for the query parameters in the **Query Parameters** section containing *filter by* in their description.

`id` is a common filter amongst all list endpoints. It allows you to filter by a resource’s unique identifier. For example, when listing devices, you can filter by the [**device id**](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/devices/list#parameter-id) using **`id=<device-id>`** in the request URL.

The following uses the **`id=dvc_123`** filter to only include the device with the `dvc_123` `id`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

Filtering by id will return at most one resource, since IDs are unique. Other fields, like [config instance activity status](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/config-instances/list#parameter-activity-status), can return multiple results.
## Multi-Value Filters

To filter by multiple values, specify the filter values as a `|` separated list: `<filter_name>=<value_1>|<value_2>|<value_3>`.

Thus, to filter devices by multiple ids, you can use the `id` filter with a `|` separated list of ids: `id=dvc_123|dvc_456|dvc_789`.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123|dvc_456|dvc_789' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

## Combining Filters

You can combine filters using `&`. All filters are combined with AND logic, so resources must match all criteria.

The following request filters the device list to only include the devices with the ids `dvc_123` and `dvc_456` and the name `Robot A`: `id=dvc_123|dvc_456&name=Robot%20A`.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123|dvc_456&name=Robot%20A' \ 
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

## URL Encoding

When using filters with special characters, make sure to properly URL encode the values.

For example, spaces are URL encoded as `%20`. Browsers and client applications will automatically URL encode the values for you, so you shouldn't need to worry about it but it's good to know.

The following request filters the device list to only include the device with the name `My Device Name` using the `name=My%20Device%20Name` filter.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices?name=My%20Device%20Name' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```
