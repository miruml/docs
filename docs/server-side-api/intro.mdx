With the Miru Server-Side API, you can programmatically manage your Miru resources, useful for provisioning devices, deploying configurations, and more.

To get started, continue to the [Authentication](/docs/server-side-api/authn) page to learn how to authenticate your requests. Then, explore the basics of the Miru API by reading through the [Query Parameters](/docs/server-side-api/query-params) section.

For information about a specific API endpoint, visit the [**Endpoints**](https://docs.miruml.com/docs/server-side-api/config-instances) section.
