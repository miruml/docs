The Miru Agent API allows you to programmatically interact with the Miru Agent running locally on your robot, useful for manually refreshing configurations, retrieving configurations, and more.

<Note>
The Miru Agent API is not available over the internet. It is only available on the device running the agent.
</Note>

The Miru Agent API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST), and is available over the Unix socket `/run/miru/miru.sock` on the device running the agent.

To get started, continue to the [Authentication](/docs/api-reference/agent/authn) page to learn how requests are authenticated.
