title: "Filtering"

API list endpoints support filtering to help you find specific resources. For example, when [listing devices](/docs/api-reference/devices/list#parameter-id) you can filter by id or name.

Filtering allows you to search results based on various criteria, simplifying your queries and reducing the number of results you need to process.



## Single Value Filters

To filter an endpoint, simply add the filter parameter to the request URL in the format `<filter_name>=<value>`.

Each list endpoint supports their own set of filter names. To see the filters supported by a specific endpoint, look for the query parameters in the **Query Parameters** section containing *filter by* in their description.

One filter common to all list endpoints is `id`, which allows you to filter by a resource's unique identifier. When listing devices, you can filter by the [device id](/docs/api-reference/devices/list#parameter-id) using `id=<device-id>` in the request URL.

The following request filters the device list to only include the device with the id `dvc_123` using the `id=dvc_123` filter.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

Of course, filtering by id can return, at most, one resource since each resource has a unique id. 

Other fields, such as the config instance [activity status](http://localhost:3000/docs/api-reference/config-instances/list#parameter-activity-status), are not unique amongst their resources and can therefore return multiple results when being filtered.

## Multi-Value Filters

To filter by multiple values, specify the filter values as a `|` separated list: `<filter_name>=<value_1>|<value_2>|<value_3>`.

Thus to filter devices by multiple ids, you can use the `id` filter with a `|` separated list of ids: `id=dvc_123|dvc_456|dvc_789`.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123|dvc_456|dvc_789' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

## Combining Filters

You can combine multiple filters to create more specific queries. All filters are applied with AND logic, meaning resources must match all specified filters.

Thus, if filtering devices by `id` and `name`, only devices that match both the `id` and `name` filters are returned.

The following request filters the device list to only include the devices with the ids `dvc_123` and `dvc_456` and the name `Robot A`: `id=dvc_123|dvc_456&name=Robot%20A`.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices?id=dvc_123|dvc_456&name=Robot%20A' \ 
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

## URL Encoding

When using filters with special characters, make sure to properly URL encode the values.

For example, spaces are URL encoded as `%20`. Browsers and client applications will automatically URL encode the values for you, so you shouldn't need to worry about it but it's good to know.

The following request filters the device list to only include the device with the name `My Device Name` using the `name=My%20Device%20Name` filter.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices?name=My%20Device%20Name' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```
