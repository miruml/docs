title: "Pagination"
---

API resources support bulk fetching through list endpoints. For example, you can [list config instances](/docs/api-reference/config-instances/list) in a workspace. All list endpoints share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the `limit` and `offset` query parameters.

The Miru API uses pagination to handle large datasets efficiently. When listing resources, the API returns a limited number of items along with pagination metadata to navigate the complete dataset.

Currently, the Miru API uses offset-based pagination but support for cursor-based pagination is coming soon. 

## Query Parameters

All list endpoints accept the `limit` and `offset` query parameters, both of which are optional.

### Limit

`limit` specifies the maximum number of items which can be returned in a single request. The default is 10 while the maximum is 100.

### Offset

`offset` specifies the starting position of the current page. The default is 0.

### Example

A limit of 10 with an offset of 0 returns items 1-10. A limit of 15 with an offset of 10 returns the items 21-35.

To specify the limit and offset, simply add the `limit` and `offset` query parameters to the list endpoint URL.

The following request specifies a limit of 10 and an offset of 0 by appending `?limit=10&offset=0` to the list endpoint URL.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/config_instances?limit=10&offset=0' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

## List Response Format

Every list response follows the same structure.

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "total_count": -1,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0,
  "has_more": false,
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "config_instance",
      "id": "cfg_inst_123",
      ...
    },
    {
      "object": "config_instance",
      "id": "cfg_inst_456",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Object

`object` is always a string with the value "list" to indicate that this is a list response.

**Total Count**

`total_count` is the total number of items matching the query. By default, the total count is not computed (and thus set to `-1`) to avoid the performance cost of counting all items.

To get the total count, you must explicitly request it using the `expand[]=total_count` parameter. While useful, the total count is typically not needed and can incur significant performance costs so please use judiciously. See the `total_count` [expansion](/docs/api-reference/query-params/expansions#total-count) documentation for more information about retrieving the total count. 

### Limit

`limit` is the limit actually used for the response. If a valid limit is specified, such as 10, the returned `limit` will be identical the requested `limit`. However, if an invalid limit is specified, such as 1001 (too large), the closest valid limit will be used instead (100 in the case of 1001).

### Offset

`offset` is the offset actually used for the response. If a valid offset is specified, such as 5, the returned `offset` will be identical the requested `offset`. However, if an invalid offset is specified, such as -3 (is negative), the closest valid offset will be used instead (0 in the case of -3).

### Has More

`has_more` is a boolean indicating whether there are more items available after the current page. If `true`, there are more items available and you can request the next page by increasing the offset by the limit. 

### Data

`data` is an array containing the actual response items. The number of items in the `data` array will be less than or equal to the `limit` specified in the response.

## Pagination Walkthrough

To paginate a request, continually request the next page until `has_more` is `false`. The next page uses the same `limit` but the `offset` is increased by the `limit`.

First, let's make a request with a limit of 10 and an offset of 0.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/config_instances?limit=10&offset=0' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

The response will look like similar to the following:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "total_count": -1,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0,
  "has_more": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "config_instance",
      "id": "cfg_inst_123",
      ...
    },
    {
      "object": "config_instance",
      "id": "cfg_inst_456",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

If `has_more` is `false`, there are no more items after the current page. If `has_more` is `true`, more items exist after the current page. The next pagination request uses the same `limit` but the `offset` is increased by the `limit`: `offset = offset + limit`. 

This gives us an offset of 10 and a limit of 10. Simply repeat this process until `has_more` is `false`. The next request would use an offset of 20 and a limit of 10, then 30 and 10, and so on.
