## API Keys
The Miru API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Miru Dashboard](https://configs.miruml.com/secrets/api-keys).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed by including your API key in the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://configs.api.miruml.com/v1/devices' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Create an API Key

To create an API key, navigate to the [API Keys](https://configs.miruml.com/secrets/api-keys) page in the Miru Dashboard.

Click **New API Key** in the top right corner of the page, give a description of the key, and click **Create**.

<Warning>
Once an API key has been created, it can never be retrieved again. If you lose your API key, you must create a new one.
</Warning>
