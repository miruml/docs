The Miru API allows you to programmatically manage your Miru resources, useful for provisioning devices, managing configurations, building custom dashboards, and more.

The Miru API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

To get started, continue to the [Authentication](/docs/api-reference/authn) page to learn how to authenticate your requests. Afterward, explore the basics of the Miru API by reading through the [Query Parameters](/docs/api-reference/query-params) section.

For information about a specific API endpoint, navigate to the [Endpoints](/docs/api-reference/config-instances) section.
