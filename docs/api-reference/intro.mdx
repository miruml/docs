With the Miru API, you can programmatically manage your Miru resources, useful for provisioning devices, managing configurations, building custom dashboards, and more.

The API follows REST principles with predictable, resource-oriented URLs. It accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)) request bodies, returns [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) responses, and uses standard HTTP methods, authentication, and status codes.

To get started, continue to the [**Authentication**](https://docs.miruml.com/docs/api-reference/authn) page to learn how to authenticate your requests.  Then, explore the basics of the Miru API by reading through the [**Query Parameters**](https://docs.miruml.com/docs/api-reference/query-params) section.
