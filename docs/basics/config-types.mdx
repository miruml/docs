## Overview
Config types organize the various types of configurations that are consumed by your robot's software. Config types

!!FIXME!!

Config types are the most important container for config schemas and config instances. All schemas and instances belong to exactly one config type.

## Fields

<ParamField path="name">
Config type names are a human-readable name for a config type. Names may contain most characters such as spaces, special characters, and punctuation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="slug">
Config type slugs are a unique, code-friendly identifier for a config type. 

Config type slugs are not typically displayed in the web dashboard. Instead, their primary use is in code. For instance, config schemas are annotated with a slug to associate them with their config type. 

As such, config type slugs are immutable--once created, slugs cannot be modified. Furthermore, slugs must satisfy the following constraints:

- Contain only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens (`-`)
- Start and end with a lowercase letter or digit
- Contain between 1 and 32 characters

</ParamField>
