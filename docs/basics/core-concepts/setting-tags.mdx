## Cloud-Based
Unlike config schemas, configuration data is not stored in a git repository. Instead, 
configuration data is **stored in the cloud** and is accessible via the Miru dashboard 
or programmatically via the Miru REST API. 

Miru uses the concepts of **devices**, **tags**, and **metadata** to structure how 
configuration data is stored and used. 

Think of tags and metadata as a datastore for configuration data. This data is then 
referenced by overrides to render config instances in the format of a particular 
config schema.

## Devices

## Tags

Groups of devices share configurations based on criteria like hardware, customers, 
location, etc. Miru uses the concepts of **tag types** and **tags** to group devices 
in a logical way.

## Customization
**Tags are completely defined by you.** We gave examples with the `hardware`, 
`accelerometer`, and `environment` tag types. However, you can define any tag type you 
want and create any amount of tags for each tag type.

This flexibility allows you to tailor tags to the needs of your application. Maybe your 
customers don't have unique configurations. A customer tag type would be unnecessary 
then. You may have many different sensor types. Defining a tag type for each sensor 
type would then prove useful.

The metadata stored for devices and tags are also completely defined by you. We showed 
simple examples of metadata and their schemas: a device storing a `robot_id` and 
`hardware` tags storing supported features like `jump`, `spin`, and `backflip`. 
However, you can define the metadata custom to your application.
