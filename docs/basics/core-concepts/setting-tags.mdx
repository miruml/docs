## Cloud-Based
Unlike config schemas, configuration data is not stored in a git repository. Instead, configuration data is **stored in the cloud** and is accessible via the Miru dashboard or programmatically via the Miru REST API. 

Miru uses the concepts of **clients**, **tags**, and **metadata** to structure how configuration data is stored and used. 

Think of tags and metadata as a datastore for configuration data. This data is then referenced by policies to distribute concrete configs in the format of a particular config schema.

## Clients

## Tags

Groups of clients share configurations based on criteria like hardware, customers, location, etc. Miru uses the concepts of **tag types** and **tags** to group clients in a logical way.

## Customization
Tags are completely defined by you. We gave examples with the `hardware`, `accelerometer`, and `environment` tag types. However, you can define any tag type you want and create any amount of tags for each tag type.

This flexibility allows you to tailor tags to the needs of your application. Maybe your customers don't have unique configurations. A customer tag type would be unnecessary then. You may have many different sensor types. Defining a tag type for each sensor type would then prove useful.

The metadata stored for clients and tags are also completely defined by you. We showed simple examples of metadata and their schemas: a client storing a `robot_id` and `hardware` tags storing supported features like `jump`, `spin`, and `backflip`. However, you can define the metadata custom to your application.
