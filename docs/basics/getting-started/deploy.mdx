## SDK in Development
To begin using the Miru C++ SDK, navigate to the `/cpp` directory of the [getting-started](https://github.com/miruml/getting-started) repository.

Build the CMake project.

```bash
cmake -B build -S .
```
```bash
cmake --build build
```

The [from_file](https://github.com/miruml/getting-started/tree/main/cpp/examples/from_file/main.cpp) example demonstrates how to use the SDK in development by loading a concrete config from a file on the local file system.

```bash
./build/examples/from_file/from-file
```

The example simply reads in a concrete config from the file system and lists the parameters inside. Make sure you read the code and examine the output to understand what's going on.


## Miru Agent

To use the Miru SDK in production, the agent must be installed and activated. Before installing, double check your platform is supported.

<AgentSupportedPlatforms />

### Install
<InstallAgent />

### Verify
<VerifyAgent />

## SDK in Production
Navigate back to the `/cpp` directory of the [getting-started](https://github.com/miruml/getting-started) repository.

The [from_agent](https://github.com/miruml/getting-started/tree/main/cpp/examples/from_agent/main.cpp) example demonstrates how to use the SDK in production by loading a concrete config from the Miru agent.

```bash
./build/examples/from_agent/from-agent
```

As before, the example simply reads in a concrete config from the agent and lists the parameters inside.
