### Create the Config
To push a schema, it's config must first be created. Navigate to the [Configs page](https://configs.miruml.com/configs) in the Miru dashboard.

        alt="Create Config Page" 
    />
</Frame>

Click `+ New Config` and name the config `Mobility` with slug `mobility`.

<Warning>
    Config slugs are permanent and cannot be changed after creation.
</Warning>

### Config Slugs
The config slug is a unique identifier for a config. It's used by both the CLI and SDK to link your schema to the right config.

Your JSON Schema file must include a `$miru_config_slug` field at the root level. We've
included this field for you in `mobility.schema.yaml`.

```yaml mobility.schema.yaml
$miru_config_slug: "mobility"
---
```

### Install the CLI

Schemas are pushed via the Miru command-line interface (CLI). We'll need to install the CLI and login to continue.

### Push to Miru
