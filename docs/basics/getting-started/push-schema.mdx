### Create the Config Type
To push a schema, it's config type must first be created in the Miru dashboard. Navigate to the [Config Types page](https://configs.miruml.com/configs).

Click `+ New Config Type` and name the config type `Mobility` with slug `mobility`.

<Warning>
    Config Type slugs are permanent and cannot be changed after creation.
</Warning>

The config type slug is a unique identifier for a config type. The CLI uses it to link a config schema to its corresponding config type when pushing a schema.

All config schemas must include the `$miru_config_type_slug` field at the root level. We've
already included this field in `mobility.schema.yaml`.

```yaml mobility.schema.yaml
$miru_config_type_slug: "mobility"
...
```

### Install the CLI

Schemas are pushed via the Miru command-line interface (CLI). To create a schema, you'll need to install the CLI on your development machine.

### Push to Miru
Navigate back to the root of the [getting-started](https://github.com/miruml/getting-started) 
repository and push the schema to Miru.

```bash
miru schema push ./schemas/mobility.schema.yaml
```

You'll see a confirmation message that your schema was successfully pushed.

```bash
üì¶ Attempting to push 1 config schemas...
