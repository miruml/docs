### Create the Config Type
To push a schema, it's config type must first be created. Navigate to the 
[Config Types page](https://configs.miruml.com/configs) in the Miru dashboard.

<Warning>
    Config Type slugs are permanent and cannot be changed after creation.
</Warning>

### Config Type Slugs
The config type slug is a unique identifier for a config type. It's used by both the CLI and SDK to link a config schema to its corresponding config type.

All config schemas must include the `$miru_config_type_slug` field at the root level. We've
already included this field in `mobility.schema.yaml`.

```yaml mobility.schema.yaml
$miru_config_type_slug: "mobility"
...
```

### Install the CLI

Schemas are pushed via the Miru command-line interface (CLI).
