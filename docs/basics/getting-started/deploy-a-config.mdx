### Install the Agent
To deploy a config instance, you'll need to install the Miru agent on your device. Before installing, double check your device's platform is supported.

<SupportedPlatforms />

<InstallAgent />

### Deploy a Config Instance
Navigate to the [Devices page](https://configs.miruml.com/devices) and click the device you want to deploy a config instance to.

Click the **New Configuration** button in the top left.

</Frame>

Select the [config schema](/docs/basics/vocabulary#config-schema) you want the new config instance to adhere to. The config instance is autopopulated with the default values from the schema. To edit the config instance beyond the defaults, click **Next**.

<Note>
   If you're following along with the schemaless approach, you'll find the the config instance is autopopulated with an empty json object since the schema is empty. This is expected, simply continue with any edits you'd like to make in the next step.
</Note>

Make any additional edits to the config instance. Then click **Deploy** in the top right.

</Frame>

A dialog will appear allowing you to edit the target file path and confirm the deployment. 

By default the config instance is deployed to `/srv/miru/config_instances/mobility/schema_v1/instance.json` (the target file path). 

The `/srv/miru/config_instances` directory is the base directory the miru agent uses for all config instances. For security reasons, this directory cannot be changed.

However, `mobility/schema_v1/instance.json` can be renamed to any desired path, as long as the file extension is `.json`.

Once you are satisfied with the target file path, continue by selecting **Deploy**.

</Frame>

The config instance will begin in the `Queued` state, awaiting the agent to recognize the new config instance desires to be deployed. If the agent is offline (poor network connection, device powered off, etc.), the config instance will remain in the `Queued` state until the agent is online again.

Once the agent is online, the config instance will move to the `Deployed` state, indicating the config instance has been successfully deployed to the target file path on the device.

### Edit a Config Instance
To edit a config instance, simply start making changes from a current config instance. As edits are made, a log on the right maintains a list of all changes, categorizing them by their type (e.g. `added`, `deleted`, `modified`).

Once satisfied with the edits, click **Deploy** in the top right.

A dialog will appear to confirm the deployment. Add a description for the deployment and click **Deploy**.

<Frame>
   ![](/images/getting-started/deploy-config-edit-dialog.png)
</Frame>

As before, the config instance will begin in the `Queued` state, moving to the `Deployed` state once the agent is online and has successfully deployed the new config instance.

### History
You can view a full history of config instances deployed to a device by clicking the **Deployments** tab in the top left, next to the **Editor** tab.

Clicking into a config instance will show historical information such as who deployed the config instance, when it was deployed, and the description message at the time of deployment.
