The Miru C++ SDK relies on CMake for integration. The [build requirements](https://github.com/miruml/cpp-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#build-requirements) and [build options](https://github.com/miruml/cpp-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#cmake-options) can be found in the official [C++ SDK repository](https://github.com/miruml/cpp-sdk).

### Integrate
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="FetchContent">
        Include the FetchContent module in your CMake file.

        ```CMake
        # this should be somewhere in your cmake file
        include(FetchContent)

        ...

        # set the desired miru options (feel free to change these)
        set(MIRU_FETCH_BOOST ON)
        set(MIRU_BUILD_TESTS OFF)
        set(MIRU_BUILD_EXAMPLES ON)

        FetchContent_Declare(
            miru
            GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/miruml/cpp-sdk.git  # Replace with actual repo URL
            GIT_TAG v0.1.0 # replace with desired tag/branch/commit
        )

        FetchContent_MakeAvailable(miru)

        ...

        # link the miru sdk 
        target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE miru::miru)
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="add_subdirectory">
        You can also clone the repository locally and add it as a subdirectory to your project.

        Clone the repository into your desired directory
        ```bash
        # replace with desired tag
        git clone -b v0.1.0 https://github.com/miruml/cpp-sdk.git
        ```

        ```CMake
        # set the desired miru options (feel free to change these)
        set(MIRU_FETCH_BOOST ON)
        set(MIRU_BUILD_TESTS OFF)
        set(MIRU_BUILD_EXAMPLES ON)

        add_subdirectory("path/to/miru/sdk/repo", "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/miru")

        ...

        # link the miru sdk
        target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE miru::miru)
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
    Support for more integration methods and package managers is coming soon.
