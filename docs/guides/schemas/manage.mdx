## View a schema

Clicking a schema will bring up the schema details panel. Select the **Content** tab to view the schema's content and select the **Metadata** tab to view the schemas metadata.

## Edit a schema

Most config schema properties are immutable. However, some properties, such as the `instance_filepath`, may be updated after schema creation. 

Editing the `instance_filepath` property does not affect existing config instances, including those which have been staged for a future deployment. 

However, any config instances created after the `instance_filepath` property is updated will be deployed to the file path specified in the updated `instance_filepath` property.

For a full reference of editable properties, look for the <MutableBadge size="xs"/> badge in the [properties](/docs/guides/schemas/overview#properties) section of the schema overview.

To edit a schema, click on the ellipses (...) of the schema you want to edit and click **Edit**.

Update the desired fields and hit **Save**.

## Delete a schema

Deleting a config schema is only possible if there exist no config instances for that schema. As such, most schemas cannot be deleted.

<Warning>
  Deleting a config schema cannot be undone.

To delete a config schema, click the ellipses of the config schema you want to delete and select **Delete**.
