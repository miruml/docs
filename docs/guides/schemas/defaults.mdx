## Overview

While schemas are primarily used to validate config instances, a secondary purpose is to define default values for config instances.

Schemas are a perfect place to define default configuration values. By placing defaults in the schema itself, values are naturally migrated and versioned alongside the schema, preventing drift between default configurations and schema versions.

While some configurations, such as calibrations, do not have sensible default values, defaults should be leveraged for the majority of parameters.

Each schema language has its own way of defining and handling default values--JSON Schema uses the `default` keyword while CUE supports the `| *` syntax.

Below are examples of JSON Schema and CUE defining `conservative` as the default value for the `navigation_mode` property.

<CodeGroup>
```yaml JSON Schema
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
title: Defaults
type: object
properties:
    navigation_mode:
        type: string
        enum: [conservative, aggressive]
        default: conservative
required:
- navigation_mode
```

```cue CUE
navigation_mode: "conservative" | "aggressive" | *"conservative"
```
</CodeGroup>

Miru integrates directly with the default values in your schemas. When creating a new config instance, Miru automatically populates the instance with the defaults provided by the schema.

For more information on the expected behavior of default values with Miru, visit the defaults section of a given schema language in the [Schema languages](/docs/guides/schemas/languages) guide.


### Default validation

JSON Schema considers default values [annotations](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/annotations)--supplementary information that is not part of the schema itself. As a result, JSON Schema allows the definition of properties which contain invalid default values.

For example, the following schema defines the property `foo` with a default value of `"bar"`, which is an invalid value for a number type. 

```yaml
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
type: object
properties:
  foo:
    type: number
    default: "bar"
```

Miru conducts additional checks to reject schemas with invalid default values. Thus, while JSON Schema allows the above schema, uploading to Miru will throw an error.

Miru does this since the default values given in a schema auto-populate config instances at various parts of the application. As such, it's critical that the default values are valid.
