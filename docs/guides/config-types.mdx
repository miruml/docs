## Properties
Config types are pretty straightforward, leveraging only a few properties. Nonetheless, config types are quite useful for organizing and managing config schemas and instances.

The following properties are used to identify and manage a config type. 

<ParamField path="name">

<MutableBadge />

A human-readable display name that can contain most characters such as spaces, special characters, and punctuation. Must contain between 1 and 48 characters.

Examples: `Mobility`, `Safety Features`, `Perception`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="slug">

<ImmutableBadge />

A unique, code-friendly identifier used to associate schemas with their config type. 

Slugs are immutable and must satisfy the following constraints:

- Contain only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens (`-`)
- Start and end with a lowercase letter or digit
- Contain between 1 and 48 characters

Slugs are primarily used in code to reference config types in a human-readable format. For instance, config schemas are annotated with a config type slug to associate the schema with the corresponding config type.


Examples: `mobility`, `safety-features`, `perception`
</ParamField>

## Delete a config type

Deleting a config type is only possible if there exist no config instances for that config type. As such, most config types cannot be deleted.

If no config instances exist for the config type, deleting a config type removes all associated schemas.

<Warning>
  Deleting a config type cannot be undone.
</Warning>

To delete a config type, click the ellipses of the config type you want to delete and select **Delete**.
