## Properties

The following properties are used to identify and manage a config type. 

Config types are pretty straightforward, leveraging only a few properties. Nonetheless, config types are quite useful for organizing and managing config schemas and instances.

<ParamField path="name">
A human-readable display name that can contain most characters such as spaces, special characters, and punctuation.

Examples: `Mobility`, `Safety Features`, `Perception`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="slug">
A unique, code-friendly identifier used to associate schemas with their config type. 

Slugs are used in code to reference a config type. For instance, every config schema is annotated with a config type slug to associate it with the correct config type.

Slugs are immutable and must satisfy the following constraints:

- Contain only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens (`-`)
- Start and end with a lowercase letter or digit
- Between 1 and 32 characters

Examples: `mobility`, `safety-features`, `perception`
</ParamField>

## Delete a config type

Deleting a config type is only possible if there exist no config instances for that config type. As such, most config types cannot be deleted.

Given that no config instances exist for the config type (deleted or otherwise), deleting a config type removes all associated schemas with it.

<Warning>
  Deleting a config type cannot be undone.
</Warning>

To delete a config type, navigate to the config type page. Then click the ellipses of the config type you want to delete and select **Delete**.
