## Overview

Miru natively supports the use of JSON Schema to validate configurations. However, you may find it simpler to validate configurations with your own software stack instead of relying on JSON Schema.

To support this, Miru provides webhooks and server-side APIs. The setup involves two primary steps:

1. Deploy an endpoint that validates [deployments](/docs/getting-started/concepts#deployments) for your application.
2. Supply the endpoint's URL to Miru and add Miru's authentication to the endpoint.

Once the endpoint is integrated, validation occurs in two parts:

1. Miru sends [deployment.validate](/docs/references/webhooks/events/deployments/validate) webhook events to your endpoint whenever deployments require validation.
2. Your endpoint sends validation results back to Miru using the [validate deployment API](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/deployments/validate).

This section guides you through the process of integrating an endpoint with Miru. An example [Flask server](https://github.com/miruml/custom-validation), which leverages the [Miru server-side SDK](/docs/references/server-side-api/sdks/python), is provided to get you started.

You may host the endpoint however you'd like as long as it is accessible over HTTPS.

If want to set up a server on your local machine for testing or want a more in-depth walkthrough of the process, skip this section in favor of the the [Local Testing](/docs/guides/custom-validation/local-testing) section. */}

## Enable custom validation

Custom validation is enabled on a per-[release](/docs/getting-started/concepts#release) basis. Enabling it on one release has no impact on other releases.

To enable custom validation for a release, navigate to the [Releases](https://app.miruml.com/releases) page. Click the ellipses on the far right of the release you would like to enable and select **Edit** from the dropdown.

</Frame>

Toggle the **Custom Validation** setting and click **Save**.

<Warning>
  Enabling custom validation _requires_ deployments to be validated. If you do not have a validation endpoint set up, deployments on this release will be unable to deploy.
</Warning>

## Create an endpoint

Next, you'll need to supply the URL of the endpoint to Miru.

If you haven't deployed the endpoint yet, that's okay. You can change the URL at any time, so feel free to follow along and deploy the endpoint later.

Navigate to the [webhooks](https://app.miruml.com/webhooks) page in Miru.

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.miruml.com/docs/images/webhooks/header.png)
</Frame>

Click **Add Endpoint** in the top right of the page.

Enter the full URL of your validation endpoint and subscribe to the `deployment.validate` event.

We recommend using a route similar to `/webhooks/miru`, but you may use any route you prefer.

URLs should be of the form `https://<your-domain>/<route>`. For instance, if your domain is `my-domain.com` and you want to use the route `/hooks/miru`, your URL would be `https://my-domain.com/hooks/miru`.

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.miruml.com/docs/images/webhooks/create-endpoint.png)
</Frame>

<Warning>
  Your URL must use HTTPS. HTTP is not supported.
</Warning>

Finally, enter a description for the endpoint, select the `deployment.validate` event, and click **Create**.

## Secrets

You'll need two secrets to integrate your endpoint with Miru: a webhook secret and an API key.

Webhook secrets are used to verify the authenticity of the webhook request while API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Miru API.

We recommend storing secrets in a secrets manager or other secure location. No matter where you choose to store them, be sure not to expose these secrets in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

### Webhook secret

To retrieve the webhook secret for an endpoint, click into the endpoint. Then, click the **eye** icon on the far right of the page to reveal the secret.

### API key

To create an API key for your endpoint:

<CreateAPIKey />

## Example server

The [custom-validation](https://github.com/miruml/custom-validation) repository contains an example Flask server that demonstrates webhook verification and deployment validation using the Miru server-side SDK.

### Secrets

For a plug-and-play experience with Webhook Secrets and API Keys, you may place the secrets in the [.env](https://github.com/miruml/custom-validation/blob/main/.env) file. However, for production use, we recommend storing the secrets in a secrets manager or other secure location.

### Code walkthrough

The [app.py](https://github.com/miruml/custom-validation/blob/main/flask/app.py) file is the entry point for the Flask server. Let's walk through it step by step.

The server accepts a POST request at the `/webhooks/miru` route. You may need to update this route to match the route you specified when creating the endpoint in Miru.

```python
@app.route("/webhooks/miru", methods=["POST"])
def webhook_endpoint() -> tuple[Response, int]:
```

**Verify the webhook**

First, the server verifies the webhook signature using the Webhook Secret. Make sure you've set the Webhook Secret in the `.env` file or swapped out the `get_env_var` function for your secrets manager.

```python expandable
headers = dict(request.headers)
payload = request.get_data()

try:
    # swap the get_env_var helper for your secrets manager if needed
    wh = Webhook(get_env_var("MIRU_WEBHOOK_SECRET"))
    payload = wh.verify(payload, headers)
except WebhookVerificationError as e:
    print(f"Webhook verification error: {e}")
    return jsonify({
        'valid': False,
        'message': str(e),
        'errors': []
    }), 400
```

**Handle the validation**

The server then checks if the event is the `deployment.validate` event, passing the event to the `handle_validate_deployment` function while ignoring all other events.

```python
event = miru_client.webhooks.unwrap(payload)
if event.type == "deployment.validate":
    handle_validate_deployment(event)
# ignore events which aren't deployment.validate
else:
    return jsonify({'message': 'no action required'}), 200
```

**Retrieve the deployment**

The deployment and its config instances are then retrieved from Miru using the [get deployment API](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/deployments/get). Here we use [expansions](/docs/references/server-side-api/query-params/expansions) to retrieve the deployment's device, release, and config instances.

```python
deployment = miru_client.deployments.retrieve(
    event.data.deployment.id,
    expand=[
        "device",
        "release",
        "config_instances.content",  # type: ignore
    ],
)
```

**Validate the deployment**

The deployment's config instances are then passed to the `validate_deployment` function. This is where you'll add your own validation logic. The function takes config instances as arguments and returns the validation results.

```python expandable
def validate_deployment(
    config_instances: list[types.ConfigInstance],
) -> DeploymentValidation:

    cfg_inst_validations: list[ConfigInstanceValidation] = []

    for config_instance in config_instances:
        # retrieve the config instance content
        if config_instance.content is None:
            raise ValueError("Config instance content is None")

        # do some validation on the config instance
        # ...
        _ = config_instance.content

        cfg_inst_validations.append(ConfigInstanceValidation(
            id=config_instance.id,
            message=(
                "Error message shown on the config instance level in the UI"
            ),
            parameters=[
                ParameterValidation(
                    message=(
                        "Error message shown on the parameter level in the UI"
                    ),
                    path=["path", "to", "invalid", "parameter"],
                )
            ],
        ))

    return DeploymentValidation(
        is_valid=True,
        message="Error message shown on the deployment level in the UI",
        config_instances=cfg_inst_validations,
    )
```

**Send the results**

Finally, the validation results are sent to Miru using the [validate deployment API](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/deployments/validate).

```python
response = miru_client.deployments.validate(
    deployment.id, **result.to_dict()
)
```

### Effects

The [validate deployment API](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/deployments/validate) response contains an `effect` field, which returns the effect of validating the deployment. 

Depending on the validation results and the user's intent, the deployment may be launched into one of several different states as a result. The `effect` field records what the deployment's next state is, and the `message` field explains why.

In general, the validation endpoint does not concern itself with why the deployment needs to be validated or what action should come next. Miru handles these details for you.

However, the `effect` and `message` fields provide useful system transparency to understand what the system is doing and maintain some level of auditability.

Feel free to ignore the validation effect; although you may find it helpful to log validation effects for auditing and diagnostic purposes.

**Reject**

If your endpoint sets the [is_valid](http://localhost:3000/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/deployments/validate#body-is-valid) field to be false in the [validate deployment](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/deployments/validate) request, the deployment is 'rejected', and the `effect` field returns `reject`. Rejected deployments cannot be staged or deployed to devices but are maintained for historical reference. Error messages supplied in the request are displayed in the UI for convenience.

**Stage and Deploy**

If your endpoint sets the [is_valid](http://localhost:3000/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/deployments/validate#body-is-valid) field to be true in the [validate deployment](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/deployments/validate) request, the deployment is 'approved' and the `effect` field returns `stage` or `deploy`. Depending on the user's original intent, the deployment may be staged for a future deployment or deployed immediately.

**None and Void**

In some cases, network latency or retries may cause the deployment to enter an invalid state. The `effect` field returns `none` or `void` in these exceptional cases to indicate the validation request was successfully received. However, the original intent of the user was not achieved due to errors unrelated to the validation endpoint.
