## Status
Devices leverage several states which track their registration and connectivity with the Miru servers.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `inactive` | Device has been created; Miru agent has not been installed |
| `activating` | The Miru agent is registering itself with Miru servers |
| `online` | Device has pinged Miru's servers in the last 60 seconds |
| `offline` | Device has not pinged Miru's servers in more than 60 seconds |

Devices begin in the `inactive` state. During the Miru agent install process, the device briefly enters the `activating` state before transitioning to `online`.

Once the Miru agent has been activated on a device, the device remains `online` or `offline` for the remainder of its existence--devices never transition back to `inactive` or `activating`.

The only exception to this is when a device is [reactivated](/docs/guides/devices/manage#reactivate-a-device). During reactivation, the device will briefly enter the `activating` state before transitioning back to `online`.

To view the status of a device, simply hover over the device's name on the [Devices page](/docs/guides/devices/overview#devices-page).
