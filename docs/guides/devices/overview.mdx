## Miru Agent

Configurations are deployed to devices via the [Miru Agent](/docs/agent/intro), a lightweight `systemd` service that runs on your devices, handling the deployment lifecycle of configurations. The agent offers the following functionality:

- **Syncs configurations** from the cloud to the local filesystem in real-time
- **Manages device state**, providing real-time updates of the device's status and the currently deployed configurations
- **Exposes a [REST API](/docs/references/agent-api/intro)** over a Unix socket for programmatic access by applications running on the same machine

The Miru Agent is purpose-built for delivering configurations to your devices in real-time, offering the following benefits:

- **Offline resilience** - configurations are cached locally on the machine and synced as soon as the network is available, ensuring continued operation through network interruptions
- **Secure communication** - all communication is outbound-only via HTTPS or MQTTS, ensuring secure and private communication
- **Lightweight footprint** - our rust-based agent consumes minimal resources and may be configured to only run on demand (via socket activation) for further optimization
- **Open-source** - the agent is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/miruml/agent)

## Status

Devices leverage several states to track their registration and connectivity with the Miru servers.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `inactive` | Device has been created; Miru agent has not been installed |
| `activating` | The Miru agent is registering itself with Miru servers |
| `online` | Device has pinged Miru's servers in the last 60 seconds |
| `offline` | Device has not pinged Miru's servers in more than 60 seconds |

Devices begin in the `inactive` state. During the Miru agent install process, devices briefly enter the `activating` state before transitioning to `online`.

Once the Miru agent has been activated on a device, the device remains `online` or `offline` for the remainder of its existence--devices don't transition back to `inactive` or `activating`.

The only exception to this is when a device is [reactivated](/docs/guides/devices/manage#reactivate-a-device). During reactivation, the device briefly enters the `activating` state before transitioning back to `online`.

To view the status of a device, simply hover over the device's name on the [Devices page](/docs/guides/devices/overview#devices-page).
