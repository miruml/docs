title: "Deploy a config"

## Create a release

The final preparation step before deploying a config instance is to create a software release to associate it with.

Navigate to the [Releases page](https://app.miruml.com/releases) .

</Frame>

Click the **New Release** button in the top right and supply a version for the release.

</Frame>

Select `Mobility` version `v1.0` and click **Create**.

## Deploy a config

We're ready to deploy a config instance to a device.

Navigate back to the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices) and click into the device we activated in the previous step.

Select the release we just created and hit **Next**.

</Frame>

Input the desired `Mobility` config instance.

</Frame>

<Note>
  The instance is auto-populated with the default values defined in the `Mobility` config schema. If using the empty schema, the auto-populated instance will be empty.
</Note>

Finally, give the deployment a description and click **Deploy**.

## Verify the deployment

To verify the config seen in the editor is deployed to the device, drop down the deployed config instance (the one with the green dot) in the editor.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/devices/editor/history-entry.png)
</Frame>

The `File Path` field shows the file system path that the config instance is deployed to relative to `/srv/miru/config_instances`. 

Since our `File Path` is `/mobility.json`, the config instance is deployed to `/srv/miru/config_instances/mobility.json`.

To verify the config instance is deployed to the device's file system, open a terminal on the device and navigate to the `/srv/miru/config_instances` directory.

```bash
cd /srv/miru/config_instances
```

Then `cat` the config instance by copying the `File Path` displayed in the editor.

```bash
cat mobility.json
```

You should find that the content of the editor is identical to the content of the config instance on the device.

## Edit a config

To edit a config instance, make some changes to the current config instance. As edits are made, a log on the right maintains a list of all changes, categorizing them by their type: `added`, `deleted`, or `modified`.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/devices/editor/modifications.png)
</Frame>

<Warning>
  Only the latest config instance for a config type may be edited. All other config instances are read-only.
</Warning>

Once you are satisfied with the edits, click **Deploy** in the top right.

A dialog will appear to confirm the deployment. Add a description for the deployment, confirm the device, and click **Deploy**.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and edited a config instance to a device with Miru!
