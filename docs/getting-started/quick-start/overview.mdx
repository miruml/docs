This quick-start guide walks through deploying your first configuration with Miru. Here's what we'll cover:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating a config schema">
    We'll create the `Mobility` config type, install the [Miru CLI](/docs/references/cli/install), and push a schema to Miru.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Installing the agent">
    Next, we'll install and activate the [Miru Agent](/docs/developers/agent/intro) on your target device.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploying config instances">
    Finally, we'll deploy config instances and make some edits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Concepts

To begin, let's define the primary concepts in Miru.

### Config instances

<CfgInstDef />

### Config schemas

<ConfigSchemaDef />

<Tip>
  If you don't already use a schema, we recommend starting with an [empty schema](/docs/learn/schemas/overview#empty-schemas)--a schema that regards all config instances as valid.
</Tip>

### Config types

<ConfigTypeDef />

### Devices

<DeviceDef />

### Releases

<ReleaseDef />

### Deployments

<DeploymentDef />

<Note>
  If these concepts are a bit fuzzy at the moment, don't worry! Seeing these concepts in action will solidify their meaning.
