Workspaces are the highest level organizational unit in Miru. They contain every sub-resource, such as devices, releases, deployments, config instances, etc.

There is no limit to the number of members a workspace can have. However, a given email address can only belong to a single workspace.

## Update the workspace name

To be able to update the workspace name, you must have one of the following roles:
- Admin
- Owner

To update your workspace's name, navigate to the [workspace](https://app.miruml.com/settings/workspace) page. 

Edit the **Name** field and hit **Enter** on your keyboard.
