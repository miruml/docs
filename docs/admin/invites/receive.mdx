This section covers invites received by users *who already have a Miru account*. If you do not yet have a Miru account, simply follow the instructions sent in the invitation email to join a workspace.

## Accept an invite
Since user accounts can only belong to a single workspace, accepting an invite from another workspace transfers you from your current workspace to the workspace you've been invited to:

- You will lose all access to your current workspace
- Your status in your current workspace will be set to <Tooltip tip={LEFT_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={LEFT_TOOLTIP.cta} href={LEFT_TOOLTIP.href}>left</Tooltip>
- Logging in gives you access to the workspace you've accepted the invite from

Accepting an invite is reversible if you are *not the only <Tooltip tip={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.href}>active member</Tooltip>*. An admin from the workspace you left can invite you back at any time.

However, if you are *the only* active member of your current workspace, accepting an invite will delete the workspace and all associated resources.

To accept an invite from another workspace, navigate to the [profile](https://app.miruml.com/settings/profile) page and hit **Accept** on the invite you want to accept.
