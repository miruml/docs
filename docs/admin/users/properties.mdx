## Roles

Roles are the access levels of a user in a workspace. 

Users can have one of the following roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `owner` | total access to the workspace; exactly one per workspace |
| `admin` | administrative and application access to the workspace; is subordinate to the owner |
| `member` | application access to the workspace but no administrative privileges |

### Admin permissions

Owners and admins hold administrative privileges, granting them the following permissions which are unavailable to members:

- Create a new API key 
- Update an existing API key
- Delete an existing API key
- Send an invite
- Resend an invite
- Revoke an invite
- Suspend a user
- Update another user (their name)
- Update another user's role
- Update the workspace

Of course, owners have some special immunity from the above permissions to prevent unwanted privilege escalation:

- Owners cannot be suspended
- Owners cannot have their role changed by another user

### Owner permissions

A workspace must have exactly one owner. As such, owners cannot leave their workspace or be suspended. 

However, owners can transfer ownership to another member. Thus, in addition to the above admin permissions above, owners also have a special permission for transferring workspace ownership to another member.

### Member permissions

Members hold application access to the workspace but no administrative privileges. 

We won't detail every single permission here. Suffice to say, members can perform any action that is not an administrative or owner-only action. This includes creating devices, deploying configurations, etc.

## Status

To maintain an accurate audit trail of user activity, users cannot be deleted from a workspace. However, users can be suspended by an admin or leave the workspace themselves.

As such, there are three possible statuses for a user:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `active` | the user can login and access workspace resources |
| `suspended` | the user's access was revoked by an admin; the user cannot login to the workspace nor access any resources |
| `left` | the user has left the workspace; the user cannot login to the workspace or access any resources |

Users who have been suspended or left can be re-invited to the workspace by an admin at any time via an [invite](/docs/admin/invites/send).
