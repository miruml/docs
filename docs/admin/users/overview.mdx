## Status

To maintain an accurate audit trail of user activity, users cannot be deleted from a workspace. However, users can be suspended by an admin or leave the workspace themselves.

As such, there are three possible statuses for a user:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `active` | User can login and access workspace resources |
| `suspended` | User's access was revoked by an admin |
| `left` | User has left the workspace |

Only `active` users can login and access workspace resources. `suspended` and `left` users exist purely for auditing purposes--they cannot login to the workspace or access any resources.

Users who have been suspended or left can be re-invited to the workspace by an admin at any time via [invites](/docs/admin/users/invites#send-an-invite).
