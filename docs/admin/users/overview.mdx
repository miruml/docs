## Status

To maintain an accurate audit trail of user activity, users cannot be deleted from a workspace. However, users can be suspended by an admin or leave the workspace themselves.

As such, there are three possible statuses for a user:

| Status      | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `active`    | User can log in and access workspace resources |
| `suspended` | User's access was revoked by an admin          |
| `left`      | User has left the workspace                    |

Only `active` users can log in and access workspace resources. `suspended` and `left` users exist solely for auditing purposes--they cannot log in to the workspace or access any resources.

Users who have been suspended or left can be reinvited to the workspace at any time by an admin via [invites](/docs/admin/users/invites#send-an-invite).
