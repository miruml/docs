<ParamField path="role">

<MutableBadge />

The <Tooltip tip={ROLE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ROLE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ROLE_TOOLTIP.href}>role</Tooltip> of the invitee when they join the workspace. Must be one of the following:

Examples: `admin`, `member`

</ParamField>

## Sending invites

### Prerequisites
To be able to send or revoke invites, you must be an <Tooltip tip={OWNER_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={OWNER_TOOLTIP.cta} href={OWNER_TOOLTIP.href}>owner</Tooltip> or <Tooltip tip={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.href}>admin</Tooltip> of the workspace. You can check your role on the [members](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members) page.

### Send an invite
To invite a member to your workspace, navigate to the [members](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members) page and click **Invite** in the top right corner.

Next, supply the email addresses of the members you want to invite as a comma-separated list, select their <Tooltip tip={ROLE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ROLE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ROLE_TOOLTIP.href}>role</Tooltip>, and hit **Send**.

</Frame>

An email will be sent to each member with a link to accept the invite. 

Invites expire after seven days. Once expired, a new invite must be issued for a member to join your workspace.

### Revoke an invite
To revoke an invite, navigate to the [pending invites](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members?filters=invites) tab in the members page.

Click the ellipses (...) of the invite to revoke and hit **Revoke Invite**.

### Resend an invite
Resending an invite simply sends a new email to the invitee, but does not affect the invite in any way--previous emails are still valid and the invite's expiration date is not changed.

Since resending an invite does not extend the invite's expiration date, invitees must still accept the invite within seven days of the invite's original creation. To give the invitee more time to accept an invite, create a new invite.

To resend an invite, navigate to the [pending invites](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members?filters=invites) tab in the members page.

Click the ellipses (...) of the invite to resend and hit **Resend Invite**.

## Receiving invites

This section covers invites received by users *who already have a Miru account*. If you do not yet have a Miru account, simply follow the instructions sent in the invitation email to join a workspace.

### Accept an invite
Since user accounts can only belong to a single workspace, accepting an invite from another workspace transfers you from your current workspace to the workspace you've been invited to:

- You will lose all access to your current workspace
- Your status in your current workspace will be set to <Tooltip tip={LEFT_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={LEFT_TOOLTIP.cta} href={LEFT_TOOLTIP.href}>left</Tooltip>
- Logging in gives you access to the workspace you've accepted the invite from

Accepting an invite is reversible if you are *not the only <Tooltip tip={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ACTIVE_TOOLTIP.href}>active member</Tooltip>*. An admin from the workspace you left can invite you back at any time.

However, if you are *the only* active member of your current workspace, accepting an invite will delete the workspace and all associated resources.

To accept an invite from another workspace, navigate to the [Profile page](https://app.miruml.com/settings/profile) and hit **Accept** on the invite you want to accept.

To decline an invite, navigate to your [Profile page](https://app.miruml.com/settings/profile) and hit **Decline** on the invite you want to decline.
