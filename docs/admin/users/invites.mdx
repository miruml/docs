<ParamField path="email" type="string">
  <ImmutableBadge />

  The email address of the invitee.

  Examples: `john.doe@example.com`, `jane.smith@example.com`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="expires_at" type="timestamp">
  <ImmutableBadge />

  The date and time the invite expires. Invites are valid for seven days from creation.

  Examples: `2025-11-19T12:00:00Z`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="role" type="enum">
  <MutableBadge />

  The <Tooltip tip={ROLE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ROLE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ROLE_TOOLTIP.href}>role</Tooltip> of the invitee when they join the workspace. Must be one of the following:

  - `admin`
  - `member`

</ParamField>

## Sending invites

### Prerequisites

To send or revoke invites, you must be an <Tooltip tip={OWNER_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={OWNER_TOOLTIP.cta} href={OWNER_TOOLTIP.href}>owner</Tooltip> or <Tooltip tip={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.href}>admin</Tooltip> of the workspace. You can check your role on the [members](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members) page.

### Send an invite

To invite a member to your workspace, navigate to the [members](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members) page and click **Invite** in the top right corner.

Next, supply the email addresses of the members you want to invite as a comma-separated list, select their <Tooltip tip={ROLE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ROLE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ROLE_TOOLTIP.href}>role</Tooltip>, and hit **Send**.

</Frame>

An email will be sent to each member with a link to accept the invite.

Invites expire after seven days. Once the invite expires, a new invite must be issued for a member to join your workspace.

### Revoke an invite

To revoke an invite, navigate to the [pending invites](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members?filters=invites) tab in the members page.

Click the ellipses (...) of the invite to revoke and hit **Revoke Invite**.

### Resend an invite

Resending an invite sends a new email to the invitee but does not affect the invite in any way — previous emails remain valid, and the invite's expiration date is unchanged.

Since resending an invite does not extend its expiration date, invitees must still accept it within seven days of its original creation. To give the invitee more time to accept, create a new invite.

To resend an invite, navigate to the [pending invites](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members?filters=invites) tab in the members page.

Click the ellipses (...) of the invite to resend and hit **Resend Invite**.

## Receiving invites

This section covers invites received by users _who already have a Miru account_. If you do not yet have a Miru account, follow the instructions sent in the invitation email to join a workspace.

### Accept an invite

Since user accounts can only belong to a single workspace, accepting an invite from another workspace transfers you from your current workspace to the workspace you've been invited to:

- You will lose all access to your current workspace
- Your status in your current workspace will be set to <Tooltip tip={LEFT_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={LEFT_TOOLTIP.cta} href={LEFT_TOOLTIP.href}>left</Tooltip>
- Logging in gives you access to the workspace you've accepted the invite from

Accepting an invite is reversible if you are _not the only active member_. An admin from the workspace you left can invite you back at any time.

However, if you are _the only_ active member of your current workspace, accepting an invite will delete the workspace and all associated resources.

To accept an invite from another workspace, navigate to the [Profile page](https://app.miruml.com/settings/profile) and hit **Join**.

Finally, click **Join workspace** to accept the invite and transfer workspaces.

To decline an invite, navigate to your [Profile page](https://app.miruml.com/settings/profile) and hit **Decline** on the invite you want to decline.
