## Prerequisites

To be able to manage members, you must be an <Tooltip tip={OWNER_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={OWNER_TOOLTIP.cta} href={OWNER_TOOLTIP.href}>owner</Tooltip> or <Tooltip tip={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ADMIN_TOOLTIP.href}>admin</Tooltip> of the workspace. You can check your role on the [members](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members) page.

## Change a member's role

To change a member's <Tooltip tip={ROLE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ROLE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ROLE_TOOLTIP.href}>role</Tooltip>, first navigate to the [members](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members) page.

Next, click the ellipses (...) of the member you want to change the role of, and hit **Change role**.

</Frame>

Select the new role and hit **Save**.

<Info>
  Changing an owner's role is not possible. Owners must transfer workspace ownership to another member to change their own role.
</Info>

## Suspend a member

Suspending a member immediately revokes their access to the workspace and sets their status to <Tooltip tip={SUSPENDED_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={SUSPENDED_TOOLTIP.cta} href={SUSPENDED_TOOLTIP.href}>suspended</Tooltip>:

- They are immediately logged out
- They cannot login to this workspace or access any resources (signing in with the same email address creates a new workspace with a new account)

Suspending a member is reversible. An admin can invite them back to the workspace at any time.

<Info>
  Suspending an owner is not possible. Owners must transfer workspace ownership to another member to be eligible for suspension.
</Info>

To suspend a member, first navigate to the [members](https://app.miruml.com/settings/members) page

Next, click the ellipses (...) of the member you want to suspend, and hit **Suspend user**.
