<Accordion title="1. How does the Miru agent work and how do I install it?">
The Miru agent is installed as a `systemd` service on the robot. During activation, it is authenticated using a token retrieved from the Miru UI. Once activated, the agent becomes tied to a specific **device ID**.

To install the agent, follow the instructions in the [Install the Agent guide](https://docs.miruml.com/docs/home/agent-sdk/install-agent). The page includes the install script, activation steps, and supported platforms.

After installing, you'll need to retrieve the activation token for the desired device from the [Devices page](https://configs.miruml.com/devices) in the dashboard. Paste the token into the activation prompt in your terminal to complete setup.

Once activated, the agent is ready to serve configs to the robot's application via a UNIX socket located at `/run/miru/miru.sock`.
</Accordion>

{/* <Accordion title="2. How does the Miru agent determine which config to fetch?">
Your application uses the Miru SDK and provides the path to the config schema file (e.g. `motion-planner.schema.yaml`).

The Miru agent:
- Grabs the **hash of the schema file**, which is provided by the SDK and acts as a unique version identifier.
- Combines this schema hash with the **device ID** to identify which config instance to fetch from the cloud.
- Uses the `$miru_config_type_slug` field inside the schema to determine the config slug.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. What happens in the Miru cloud when a robot asks for a config?">
Once the agent sends a request with the schema hash and device ID:
- The Miru cloud matches the request to the correct version of the config schema.
- It evaluates any **overrides** defined for that config.
- The robot's **tags** (like `region`, `hardware`, or `robot_model`) are used to resolve values from tag metadata into a final rendered config.

The resulting **config instance** is then **pulled to the device** by the agent.

This allows each robot to receive a config tailored to its tags, even if the schema is the same across the fleet.
</Accordion> */}

<Accordion title="2. How does my application use the config from the agent?">
The SDK connects to the agent over the UNIX socket and passes it the path to the schema file. The agent then returns the config instance associated with that schema and client.

The SDK returns this config as:
- A **structured, typed object** (e.g., in C++), and/or
- A **raw JSON blob**, depending on the SDK/language used.

This lets your application consume configs in a strongly typed way, aligned with the schema definition you provided.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. What happens if the robot goes offline or restarts?">
The Miru agent **caches the rendered config locally** on disk. If the robot restarts or loses network connectivity, the agent will continue to serve the last known-good config to the SDK.

This ensures robustness in the field where network drops or power cycles are common.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. How can I verify the agent is running correctly?">
You can ping the agent's test endpoint using:

```bash
sudo curl --unix-socket /run/miru/miru.sock http://localhost/v1/health
```

If successful, you'll see a JSON response like:

```json
{"server":"miru-config-agent","status":"ok"}
```

This confirms the Miru agent is installed, activated, and running.
</Accordion>

{/* <Accordion title="7. How do I know what config my robot is currently using?">
The agent always serves the latest rendered config instance it received from the cloud. You can inspect this using the Miru SDK on the device.

To do this, use the `from_agent()` method and provide the path to your config schema:

```cpp
auto config_instance = miru::configs::ConfigInstance::from_agent("/path/to/schema.yaml");
```

You can then retrieve individual parameters or iterate over all parameters in the config instance.

Note: if the device is offline, the agent serves the last known-good config instance from its local cache.
</Accordion> */}

<Accordion title="5. Can I test configs locally without the agent?">
Yes. The Miru SDK supports a development mode using `from_file()` to load config instances from disk.

This is useful for iterating quickly on schemas and config instances without needing to install or activate the agent. Most teams use this feature in their development environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="6. Does my schema need to be uploaded before using it in production?">
Yes. The Miru agent uses the **hash of the schema file** to identify which schema version to render from. That schema must already be uploaded to the cloud using `miru schema push`.

If the agent sees a schema hash it doesn't recognize, config rendering will fail.
</Accordion>
