<Accordion title="1. What happens if the robot goes offline or restarts?">
The Miru agent **caches the rendered config locally** on disk. If the robot restarts or loses network connectivity, the agent will continue to serve the last known-good config to the SDK.

This ensures robustness in the field where network drops or power cycles are common.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. How can I verify the agent is running correctly?">
You can ping the agent's test endpoint using:

```bash
sudo curl --unix-socket /run/miru/miru.sock http://localhost/v1/health
```

If successful, you'll see a JSON response like:

```json
{"server":"miru-config-agent","status":"ok"}
```

This confirms the Miru agent is installed, activated, and running.
