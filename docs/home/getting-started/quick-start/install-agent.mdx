Before deploying a config instance, we must first install the Miru Agent on the machine we want to deploy the config instance to. 

The Miru Agent is a lightweight `systemd` service that runs on your machines, handling the deployment lifecycle of configurations. For more information on the Miru Agent, visit the [Miru Agent](/docs/home/agent/intro) section.
