Before deploying config instances, we must first install the Miru Agent on the machine we want to deploy to. 

The agent is a lightweight `systemd` service that runs on your machines, handling the deployment lifecycle of configurations. For more information on the agent, visit the [Miru Agent](/docs/home/agent/intro) section.
