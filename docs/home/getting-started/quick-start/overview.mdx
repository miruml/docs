This quick-start guide walks through deploying your first configuration with Miru. Here's what we'll cover.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Defining a config schema">
    We'll create the `Mobility` config type, install the [Miru CLI](/docs/references/cli/install), and push a schema to Miru.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Installing the agent">
    Next, we'll install the [Miru Agent](/docs/home/agent/intro) on your target device and activate it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploying config instances">
    Finally, we'll deploy config instances and make some edits.
  </Step>

## Concepts

Before we begin, let's define Miru's key configuration concepts.

### Config instances
<ConfigInstanceDefinition />

### Config schemas
<ConfigSchemaDefinition />

<Tip>
  While schemas are recommended, you can use Miru schemaless.
</Tip>

### Config types
<ConfigTypeDefinition />

### Devices
<DeviceDefinition />

### Releases
<ReleaseDefinition />

### Deployments
<DeploymentDefinition />

<Tip>
  If these concepts are a bit fuzzy at the moment, don't worry! Seeing these concepts in action will solidify their meaning.
</Tip>

With these concepts in mind, let's begin!
