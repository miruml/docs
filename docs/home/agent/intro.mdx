The Miru Agent is a lightweight `systemd` service that runs on your machines, handling the deployment lifecycle of configurations. The agent offers the following functionality:

- **Syncs configurations** from the cloud to the local filesystem in real-time.
- **Manages device state**, providing real-time updates of the device's status and the currently deployed configurations.
- **Exposes a [REST API](/docs/api-reference/agent/intro)** over a Unix socket for programmatic access by applications running on the same machine.

## Key Benefits

- **Offline resilience**: Configurations are cached locally on the machine and synced as soon as the network is available, ensuring continued operation through network interruptions.
- **Secure communication**: All communication is outbound-only via HTTPS or MQTTS, ensuring secure and private communication.
- **Lightweight footprint**: Our rust-based agent consumes minimal resources and may be configured to only run on demand (via socket activation) for further optimization.
- **Open-source**: The agent is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/miruml/agent).
