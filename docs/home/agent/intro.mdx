The Miru Agent is a lightweight `systemd` service that runs on your machines, handling the deployment lifecycle of configurations. The agent offers the following functionality.

- **Syncs configurations** from the cloud to the local filesystem in real-time
- **Manages device state**, providing real-time updates of the device's status and the currently deployed configurations
- **Exposes a [REST API](/docs/references/agent-api/intro)** over a Unix socket for programmatic access by applications running on the same machine

## Key benefits

- **Offline resilience** - configurations are cached locally on the machine and synced as soon as the network is available, ensuring continued operation through network interruptions
- **Secure communication** - all communication is outbound-only via HTTPS or MQTTS, ensuring secure and private communication
- **Lightweight footprint** - our rust-based agent consumes minimal resources and may be configured to only run on demand (via socket activation) for further optimization
- **Open-source** - the agent is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/miruml/agent)
