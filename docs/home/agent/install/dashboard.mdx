## Overview

Dashboard installation is the most straightforward method for installing the Miru Agent and is ideal for getting started quickly or managing individual devices. 

This method is particularly useful for initial setup, small deployments, development environments, or when you need the visual feedback and device management capabilities of the web dashboard.

For automated deployments or provisioning multiple devices at scale, consider the [API Key](/docs/home/agent/install/api-keys) installation method.
