## Overview
The simplest way to install the Miru Agent onto a machine is via the Miru Dashboard: simply copy an activation command from the dashboard and paste it into the terminal of the machine you want to install the agent onto.

While convenient for getting started, at some point you'll likely want to automate the installation process. For a programmatic approach, check out the [API Key](/docs/home/agent/install/api-keys) installation method.
