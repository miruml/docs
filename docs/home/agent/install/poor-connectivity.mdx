title: 'Poor connectivity'
---

## Overview
Some machines may have particularly poor connectivity. Whether located in a remote area or using a cellular connection, downloading the Miru Agent over a network may be impractical in some environments.

In such scenarios, we recommend downloading the Miru Agent on a computer with a stable connection, and then transferring the agent to the target machine.

While this method circumvents the need to *download* the Miru Agent over a network, *activating* the agent still requires some level of connectivity to establish an initial connection with the Miru servers.

<Warning>
Some connectivity (however weak) is required to activate the agent. If a machine is completely offline, the agent will not be able to activate.
</Warning>

## Download the Agent
All Miru Agent releases are available as Debian packages [on GitHub](https://github.com/miruml/agent/releases). You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent/releases/latest).

<Note>
    Releases with the `Pre-release` tag are not yet considered stable and may contain bugs or other issues. Use at your own risk.
</Note>

To download the agent, drop down the **Assets** section for the desired release. You'll find several different assets. The ones we care about are those ending with the `.deb` extension-- these are the Debian packages for the Miru Agent.

The debian packages are all the same version of the Miru Agent but built for different architectures (i.e. `amd64`, `arm64`, etc.). Find the architecture which matches your target machine's architecture and download the package.

For example, if your robot is an `x86_64` machine, you'll want to download the `miru-agent_<version>_amd64.deb` package. If your robot is an `aarch64` machine, you'll want to download the `miru-agent_<version>_arm64.deb` package.

To download a package, simply click on the the filename in GitHub.

## Transfer the Agent

Once you've downloaded the appropriate debian package, transfer it to your target machine. This can be done via a variety of methods, such as a USB drive. 

## Install the Agent

After transferring the package to your target machine, install it by adding the `--from-pkg` argument to the installation command.

### API keys

If installing via an [API key](/docs/home/agent/install/api-keys), simply add the [`--from-pkg` argument](/docs/home/agent/install/api-keys#script-parameters) to the provision script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/provision.sh | sh -s -- \
--device-name=$HOSTNAME \
--allow-reactivation=true \
--from-pkg=/path/to/miru-agent_<version>_<architecture>.deb
```

<Note>
You'll need to replace `<path/to/miru-agent_<version>_<architecture>.deb>` with the actual path to the package.
</Note>

### Dashboard
If installing via the dashboard, follow these steps.

1. Copy the [installation command](/docs/home/agent/install/dashboard#retrieve-the-command) from the dashboard
2. Append `-s -- --from-pkg=/path/to/agent.deb` and replace the `<path/to/agent.deb>` with the actual path to the agent package

This will give you an installation command similar to the following.

<Warning>
Do not copy the example command below. It will not work since it does not have the appropriate activation token. Instead, follow the steps listed above.
</Warning>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/install.sh | \
env MIRU_ACTIVATION_TOKEN=<activation-token> \
sh -s -- \
--from-pkg=</path/to/agent.deb>
```
