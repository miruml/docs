<ConfigTypeDef />

## Properties

<ParamField path="name" type="string">
  <EditableBadge />

  A human-readable display name that can contain most characters, such as spaces, special characters, and punctuation. Must contain between 1 and 48 characters.

  Examples: `Mobility`, `Safety Features`, `Perception`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="slug" type="string">
  <ImmutableBadge />

  A unique, code-friendly identifier for a config type.

  Slugs are immutable and must satisfy the following constraints:

  - Contain only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens (`-`)
  - Start and end with a lowercase letter or digit
  - Contain between 1 and 48 characters

  Slugs are primarily used in code to reference config types in a human-readable format. For instance, config schemas are annotated with a config type slug to associate them with their proper config type.

  Examples: `mobility`, `safety-features`, `perception`
</ParamField>

## Delete a config type

Deleting a config type is irreversible. Once a config type is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

Deleting a config type is only possible if there are no config instances for that config type. As such, most config types cannot be deleted.

If no config instances exist for the config type, deleting a config type removes all associated schemas.

To delete a config type, click the ellipses of the config type you want to delete and select **Delete**.

A confirmation dialog will appear. Hit **Delete** to confirm the deletion.
