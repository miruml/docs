## Properties

Config schemas leverage several properties to adequately describe their format and organize them within their config type. 

All properties are immutable except for the `instance_filepath` property, which may be updated at anytime.

<ParamField path="config type" type="Config Type">

<ImmutableBadge />

The config type which the schema belongs to.

Examples: `Mobility`, `Safety Features`, `Perception`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="language" type="string">

<ImmutableBadge />

The schema language used to define the schema. 

Currently supported schema languages include:
- JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12)
- CUE

Enum: `jsonschema`, `cue`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="format" type="string">

<ImmutableBadge />

The file format used to define the schema.

Some languages, such as JSON Schema, support multiple formats (e.g. JSON, YAML) while others, such as CUE, only support a single format (i.e. CUE lang itself).

A *schema's* format does not need to match the format of the *config instance* it validates. Below are the supported schema and config instance formats for each schema language.

| Language     | Schema Formats  | Instance Formats |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| JSON Schema  | JSON, YAML      | JSON       |
| CUE          | CUE             | JSON       |

<Info>
  Support for more config instance formats including YAML and JSON-C are coming soon.
</Info>

Examples: `json`, `yaml`, `cue`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="content" type="string">

<ImmutableBadge />

The raw schema definition written in the specified schema language.

The exact contents of a schema file is preserved in Miru including any comments, whitespace, and formatting.


</ParamField>

<ParamField path="digest" type="string">

<ImmutableBadge />

A hash of the canonicalized schema content.

Digests are computed by converting a schema to a canonical format--a format which disregards whitespace, comments, and other non-semantic differences--and hashing the result. This is useful for comparing schemas and detecting duplicates.

Examples: `sha256:45YeoJJ2btBnAKQztAEXEjHsqyyQfC1z1Mw3LLM4xMUy`

</ParamField>


<ParamField path="instance file path" type="string">

<EditableBadge />

The instance file path is the file path to deploy config instances (for this schema) on a device relative to the `/srv/miru/config_instances` directory. 

The default instance file path for a schema is `{my-config-type-slug}.json`, which deploys config instances to `/srv/miru/config_instances/{my-config-type-slug}.json`.

Examples: `/v1/mobility.json`, `/config/safety.json`
</ParamField>

## Supported languages

Config schemas are defined using a schema language--a formal language for describing the structure, constraints, and data types of a configuration. 

Miru supports:
- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) (draft 2020-12)
- [CUE](https://cuelang.org/)

For more information on schema languages, visit the [languages](/docs/guides/schemas/languages) section of this guide. 

## Validating configs

The primary purpose of schemas is to validate config instances. Let's look at a simple example to see this in action.

The following is a toy schema written in JSON Schema.

```yaml JSON Schema [expandable]
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
title: Mobility
type: object
properties:
    max_linear_speed_mps:
        type: number
        minimum: 0.1
        maximum: 5.0
        default: 1.2
    max_angular_speed_radps:
        type: number
        minimum: 0.1
        maximum: 3.0
        default: 1.0
    obstacle_avoidance_enabled:
        type: boolean
        default: true
    navigation_mode:
        type: string
        enum: [conservative, balanced, aggressive]
        default: balanced
    telemetry:
        type: object
        properties:
        upload_interval_sec:
            type: integer
            minimum: 10
            maximum: 300
            default: 60
        heartbeat_interval_sec:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            maximum: 60
            default: 10
        required:
        - upload_interval_sec
        - heartbeat_interval_sec
required:
- max_linear_speed_mps
- max_angular_speed_radps
- obstacle_avoidance_enabled
- navigation_mode
- telemetry
```

The schema defines what constitutes a valid config instance in several different ways:

- Names the available properties
- Organizes the configuration structure, placing some properties at the root while nesting other properties in logical groups
- Gives each property a type, such as `number`, `boolean`, etc.
- Constrains the values of each property--minimums, maximums, enumerations, etc.
- Supplies default values to properties where appropriate

Most of these constraints are optional, and many features of JSON Schema are omitted here, but this gives you a flavor of what schemas are capable of.

Say we are deploying the following config instance.

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.miruml.com/docs/images/devices/editor/invalid-mobility-edit.png)
</Frame>

Unbeknownst to us, the `max_angular_speed_radps` field exceeds the maximum allowed value of 3.0.

Luckily, before deployment to the device, the config instance is validated against the schema, throwing the following error:

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.miruml.com/docs/images/devices/editor/invalid-mobility-err-msg.png)
</Frame>

Identifying the issue, we correct the `max_angular_speed_radps` field to use the maximum allowed value of 3.0 and deploy the config instance to the device.

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.miruml.com/docs/images/devices/editor/valid-mobility-edit.png)
</Frame>

This time the config instance successfully validates against the schema and is deployed to the device.

Although simple in concept, schemas are a powerful tool for preventing typos, misconfigurations, and other preventable errors. 

## Empty schemas

While schemas provide a lot of value for production deployments, it can be a significant undertaking to define one from scratch.

Many teams find it best to begin with an empty schema--a schema that accepts any configuration--and gradually add constraints over time. This approach allows you to define the most high value constraints first and gradually transition to stricter and stricter schemas as needed.

Below are the empty schemas for JSON Schema and CUE respectively.

<CodeGroup>
```yaml JSON Schema
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
```

```cue CUE
{}
```
</CodeGroup>
