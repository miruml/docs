## View a schema

To view a schema in Miru, navigate to the [Config Types page](https://app.miruml.com/configs) and click into the config type which contains the schema you want to view.

Clicking a schema opens the schema details panel. The **Content** tab contains the schema's content while the **Metadata** tab contains the schema's metadata.

## Edit a schema

Most config schema properties are immutable. However, some properties, such as the `instance file path`, may be updated after schema creation. 

Editing the `instance file path` property does not affect existing config instances, including those which have been staged for the future. 

However, any config instances created after the `instance file path` property is updated will be deployed to the file path specified in the updated `instance file path` property.

For a full reference of editable properties, look for the <MutableBadge size="xs"/> badge in the [properties](/docs/guides/schemas/overview#properties) section of the schema overview.

To edit a schema, click the ellipses (...) on the schema you want to edit and hit **Edit**.

Update the desired fields and hit **Save**.

## Delete a schema

Deleting a config schema is only possible if there exist no config instances for that schema. As such, most schemas cannot be deleted.

<Warning>
  Deleting a config schema cannot be undone.

To delete a config schema, click the ellipses of the config schema you want to delete and select **Delete**.
