A schema language is a formal language for describing the structure, constraints, and data types of a configuration. Config schemas are defined in a supported schema language to validate config instances before deployment.

Currently, the following languages are supported:

- [JSON Schema](/docs/learn/schemas/languages/jsonschema) (draft 2020-12)
- [CUE](/docs/learn/schemas/languages/cue)

The following sections cover key integration points for each language.

To learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of each language, check out our [blog post](https://www.mirurobotics.com/blog/config-wars-chapter-1-intro-to-schemas) comparing JSON Schema, CUE, and Protocol Buffers.
