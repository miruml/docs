Provisioning a device is the process of creating it in Miru and installing the Miru Agent on it. Once provisioned, a device is ready to receive deployments.

## Dashboard

The Miru dashboard is the simplest way to provision devices, ideal for getting started or managing individual devices.

For automated deployments or provisioning devices at scale, consider using [API Keys](#api-keys) instead.

### Create a Device

<CreateDevice />

### Install the Agent

<RetrieveCmd />

<RunCmd />

### Verify the Installation

<Verify />

## API Keys

To programmatically provision devices, Miru offers API keys.

Unlike the dashboard installation, which requires manual interaction with the web interface for each device, provisioning devices via API keys allows you to:

- **Provision multiple devices** at scale without manual intervention
- **Integrate with existing infrastructure** management tools and workflows
- **Use in headless environments** where a web browser isn't available

### Create the API Key

<CreateAPIKey />

### Provision the Device

On the device you want to install the Miru Agent, set the `MIRU_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.

```bash
export MIRU_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Execute the [provisioning script](https://github.com/miruml/agent/blob/main/scripts/install/provision.sh) to create and activate a device using your API key.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/provision.sh | sh -s -- \
  --device-name=$HOSTNAME \
  --allow-reactivation=true
```

The provision script performs the following actions:

1. **Creates the device** - creates a new device in the Miru dashboard if a device with the provided name doesn't already exist
1. **Downloads the agent** - fetches the latest Miru Agent Debian package
1. **Installs the service** - installs the agent as a `systemd` service
1. **Activates the device** - registers the agent with Miru servers using the activation token

The provision script supports the following parameters to tune your installation:

<ParamField path="--device-name" type="string">
  The name of the device in the Miru dashboard.

  Default: `$HOSTNAME`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--allow-reactivation" type="boolean">
  Allows reactivation of existing devices.

  Without this flag, only `inactive` devices can be activated. With this flag, devices that have been previously activated (status `online`, `offline`, etc.) may be reactivated.

  Default: `false`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--version" type="string">
  The agent version to install (e.g., `v0.6.0`).

  Defaults to the [latest release](https://github.com/miruml/agent/releases/latest). See all [available versions](https://github.com/miruml/agent/releases).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--from-pkg" type="string">
  The file path to the Miru Agent Debian package to use for installation. Useful for installing the agent in poor connectivity scenarios.
</ParamField>

## Poor Connectivity

Some environments may have a poor internet connection. Whether located in a remote area or using a cellular connection, downloading the Miru Agent over a network may be impractical in some environments.

In such scenarios, we recommend downloading the Miru Agent to a computer with a stable connection and then transferring it to the target machine.

While this method circumvents the need to _download_ the Miru Agent over a network, _activating_ the agent still requires some level of connectivity to register the device with the Miru servers.

<Warning>
  Some connectivity (however weak) is required to activate the agent. If a device is not connected, the agent cannot be activated.
</Warning>

### Download the Agent

All Miru Agent releases are available as Debian packages [on GitHub](https://github.com/miruml/agent/releases). You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/miruml/agent/releases/latest).

<Info>
  Releases with the `Pre-release` tag are not yet considered stable and may contain bugs or other issues. Use at your own risk.
</Info>

To download the agent, drop down the **Assets** section for the desired release. The assets ending with the `.deb` extension are the Debian packages for the Miru Agent.

<Frame>

</Frame>

The Debian packages are all the same version of the Miru Agent, but built for different architectures (i.e. `amd64`, `arm64`, etc.). Find the architecture that matches your target machine's architecture and download the package.

For example, if your robot is an `x86_64` machine, you'll want to download the `miru-agent_<version>_amd64.deb` package. If your robot is an `aarch64` machine, you'll want to download the `miru-agent_<version>_arm64.deb` package.

To download a package, click on the filename in GitHub.

### Transfer the Agent

Once you've downloaded the appropriate Debian package, transfer it to your target machine. This can be done via a variety of methods, such as a USB drive.

### Install the Agent

After transferring the package to your target machine, install it by adding the `--from-pkg` argument to the installation command.

**API keys**

If installing via an [API key](#api-keys), add the `--from-pkg` argument to the provision script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/provision.sh | sh -s -- \
--device-name=$HOSTNAME \
--allow-reactivation=true \
--from-pkg=/path/to/miru-agent_<version>_<architecture>.deb
```

<Info>
  You'll need to replace `<path/to/miru-agent_<version>_<architecture>.deb>` with the actual path to the package.
</Info>

**Dashboard**

If installing via the dashboard, follow these steps.

1. Copy the [installation command](#install-the-agent) from the dashboard
2. Append `-s -- --from-pkg=/path/to/agent.deb` and replace the `<path/to/agent.deb>` with the actual path to the agent package

This will give you an installation command similar to the following.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miruml/agent/main/scripts/install/install.sh | \
env MIRU_ACTIVATION_TOKEN=<activation-token> \
sh -s -- \
--from-pkg=</path/to/agent.deb>
```

<Warning>
  Do not copy the example command below. It will not work because it lacks the required activation token. Instead, follow the steps listed above.
</Warning>
