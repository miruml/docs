The config editor is the primary way to view and edit a device's configurations.

The editor is accessed by clicking into a device from the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices) and selecting the **Editor** tab at the top.

## Layout

The config editor is organized into three main sections.

1. Config types - a list of config types which are part of the device's current deployment
2. File editor - a VSCode-like file editor for editing configurations
3. History - a reference of the device's previously deployed config instances for the selected config type

## Customize

The config editor offers a couple of layout adjustments to help you get the most out of the editor.

**Width**

Customize the width by dragging the vertical dividers to the left or right as desired.

## Patch a config instance

Patching a config instance is the process of creating a new config instance to replace the currently deployed one.

Patching a config instance is only allowed from currently deployed config instances. Config instances that are not deployed are read-only and cannot be edited.

To patch a config instance, edit the instance in the file editor.

</Frame>

As edits are made, a log on the right maintains a list of all changes, categorizing them by their type: `added`, `deleted`, or `modified`.

Once you're satisfied with the edits, click **Deploy** in the top-right. A dialog will appear to confirm the deployment.

</Frame>

Add a description, confirm the device, and click **Deploy**.

## Config instance history

The right side of the config editor maintains a history of all the config instances deployed to the device for the currently selected config type.

</Frame>

You can view more information about a history entry by hitting the dropdown arrow to the left of the entry.

For more information about a config instance property in a history entry, see the [config instance properties](/docs/learn/config-instances#properties).

For more information about a deployment in the history entry, refer to the [deployment properties](/docs/learn/deployments#properties).

## Switch releases

Above the config types on the left, you'll find the current release version of the device's configurations.

</Frame>

To deploy configurations with a different release, click the release dropdown and select the release you want to switch to.

</Frame>

At this point, you have two options: deploy a staged deployment or create a new deployment.

### Staged deployments

If you've [staged a deployment](/docs/learn/releases/staging-area) on the chosen release for the device, the release will have the `Staged` badge next to it.

Select a release with a `Staged` badge and hit **Next**.

</Frame>

The deployment staged on this release will appear in the dialog. Select the deployment and hit **Deploy**.

### New deployments

If the release you selected has no staged deployments, you'll immediately be presented with a dialog to create a new deployment.

<Frame>

</Frame>

The dialog includes a tab for each config schema defined in the release, each pre-populated with the schema's default values.

Make any desired edits to the config instances, enter a description at the bottom of the dialog, and hit **Deploy**.
