The config editor is the primary way to view and edit a device's configurations.

The editor is accessed by clicking into a device from the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices) and selecting the **Editor** tab at the top.

## Layout

The config editor is organized into three main sections.

1. Config types - a list of config types which are part of the device's current deployment
2. File editor - a VSCode-like file editor for editing configurations
3. History - a reference of all the device's deployments

## Customize

The config editor offers a couple layout adjustments to help you get the most out of the editor.

**Width**

Customize the width by dragging the vertical dividers to the left or right as desired.

## Patch a config instance

Patching a config instance is the process of creating a new config instance to replace a currently deployed config instance.

Patching a config instance is only allowed from currently deployed config instances. Config instances which are not deployed are read-only and cannot be edited.

To patch a config instance, make some edits to the instance in the file editor.

As edits are made, a log on the right maintains a list of all changes, categorizing them by their type: `added`, `deleted`, or `modified`.

Once satisfied with the edits, click **Deploy** in the top right. A dialog will appear to confirm the deployment.

Add a description, confirm the device, and click **Deploy**.
