Each device has its own deployment history, accessible by clicking the device on the [Devices page](https://app.mirurobotics.com/devices) and selecting the **Deployments** tab.

The deployment history page lists all deployments that have been deployed to the device, regardless of release. However, staged deployments and deployments that never reached the device are not included in the deployment history.

## View a deployment

To view a deployment, select it from the list.

A panel will open on the right of the page displaying the deployment's details.
