Each device has its own deployment history, which is accessible by clicking into the device from the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices) and selecting the **Deployments** tab.

The deployment history page lists all the deployments which have ever been deployed to the device. Staged deployments and archived deployments which never made it to the device are not included.
