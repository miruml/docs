Each device has its own deployment history, which is accessible by clicking into the device from the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices) and selecting the **Deployments** tab.

The deployment history page lists the deployments which have been deployed to the device regardless of release. Staged deployments and deployments which never made it to the device are not included in the deployment history.
