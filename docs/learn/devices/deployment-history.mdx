Each device has its own deployment history, which is accessible by clicking into the device from the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices) and selecting the **Deployments** tab.

The deployment history page lists the deployments which have been deployed to the device regardless of release. Staged deployments and deployments which never made it to the device are not included in the deployment history.

## View a deployment

To view a deployment, select the deployment from the list of deployments.

A panel will open on the right of the page displaying the deployment's details.

## View a config instance

To view the details of any config instances in the deployment, click into the config instance in the **Configurations** section of the deployment panel opened in the previous section.

The content tab contains the parameters in the config instance while the metadata tab contains audit information--the author, creation date, description, etc.
