Devices are located in the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices) of the dashboard.

## Edit a device

**Dashboard**

To edit a device in the dashboard, click the ellipses (...) on the device you want to edit and hit **Edit**.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/devices/ellipses-dropdown.png)
</Frame>

Update the desired fields and hit **Save**.

  ![](/images/devices/edit-panel.png)
</Frame>

**Server-Side API**

To edit a device programmatically, use the [update device endpoint »](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/devices/update)

## Ping a device

Pinging a device sends a real-time request to the device to check if it is online. Ping requests wait a maximum of 5 seconds for a response from the device before timing out.

<Tooltip tip={ONLINE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={ONLINE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={ONLINE_TOOLTIP.href}>Online</Tooltip> devices should return a success message similar to the one below.

On the other hand, <Tooltip tip={OFFLINE_TOOLTIP.tip} cta={OFFLINE_TOOLTIP.cta} href={OFFLINE_TOOLTIP.href}>offline</Tooltip> devices should return a timeout message similar to the one below.

## Reactivate a device

Reactivating a device is the process of reinstalling the Miru Agent onto a device that has been previously activated. Reactivating a device:

1. Invalidates the device's current authentication session
2. Creates a new authentication session for the device
3. Resets the Miru Agent to a clean state
4. Recreates the device's current deployments

Reactivating a device is useful for resetting the Miru Agent on a device to a clean state while maintaining the device's full deployment history.

**Dashboard**

To reactivate a device, click the ellipses (...) on the device you want to reactivate and hit **Reactivate**.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/devices/ellipses-dropdown.png)
</Frame>

A dialog will appear with a pre-authenticated reactivation command. Copy this command and paste it into a terminal of the device you want to reactivate.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/devices/reactivate-dialog.png)
</Frame>

Outside of the reactivation capability, this installation command is identical to the activation command used when provisioning a device. For more information on the installation command, visit the [dashboard device provisioning](/docs/learn/devices/provision#install-the-agent) documentation.

**Server-Side API**

To reactivate a device programmatically, use the [API key provisioning](/docs/learn/devices/provision#api-keys) workflow with the [`--allow-reactivation`](/docs/learn/devices/provision#param-allow-reactivation) flag enabled.

## Delete a device

Deleting a device immediately invalidates the device's authentication session and deletes all deployment and configuration history for that device. This action is irreversible, please proceed with caution.

**Dashboard**

To delete a device, click the ellipses (...) on the device you want to delete and hit **Delete**.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/devices/ellipses-dropdown.png)
</Frame>

A confirmation dialog will appear--click **Delete** to confirm.

<Frame>

</Frame>

**Server-Side API**

Programmatically delete devices via the [delete device endpoint »](/docs/references/server-side-api/endpoints/devices/delete)
