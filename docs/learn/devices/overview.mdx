## Properties

<ParamField path="name" type="string">

<EditableBadge />

A human-readable display name that can contain most characters such as spaces, special characters, and punctuation. Must contain between 1 and 48 characters.

Examples: `Robot 11`, `ArcticBlaze`, `Scooby Doo`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="status" type="string">

<MutableBadge />

The status of the device.

Examples: `inactive`, `activating`, `online`, `offline`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="agent version" type="string">

<MutableBadge />{' '}<NullableBadge />

The version of the Miru Agent running on the device.

The agent version exists only if the device has a status of `online` or `offline`. If the device is `inactive` or `activating`, the agent version is `null`.

Examples: `v0.6.0`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="current release" type="Release">

<EditableBadge />{' '}<NullableBadge />

The [release](/docs/learn/releases/overview#properties) that the device's deployments must adhere to. 

If the device is `inactive` or `activating`, the current release id is `null`. If the device is `online` or `offline`, the current release may still be `null` if the device has no deployed config instances.

Examples: `rls_123`

</ParamField>

## Miru Agent

Configurations are deployed to devices via the [Miru Agent](/docs/developers/agent/intro), a lightweight `systemd` service that runs on your devices, handling the deployment lifecycle of configurations. 

The Miru Agent offers the following functionality:

- **Syncs configurations** from the cloud to the local filesystem in real-time
- **Manages device state**, providing real-time updates of the device's status and the currently deployed configurations
- **Exposes a [REST API](/docs/references/agent-api/intro)** over a Unix socket for programmatic access by applications running on the same machine

<Warning>
  The Miru Agent only supports Linux. Visit the [supported platforms](/docs/developers/agent/intro#supported-platforms) for a complete list of supported platforms.
</Warning>

## Status

Devices leverage several states to track their registration and connectivity with the Miru servers.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `inactive` | The Miru Agent has not yet been installed and authenticated |
| `activating` | The Miru Agent is registering itself with Miru servers |
| `online` | Device is currently connected to Miru's servers |
| `offline` | Device has lost connection to Miru's servers |

Devices begin in the `inactive` state. During the Miru Agent install process, devices briefly enter the `activating` state before transitioning to `online`.

Once the Miru Agent has been activated on a device, the device remains `online` or `offline` for the remainder of its existence--devices don't transition back to `inactive` or `activating`.

The only exception to this is when a device is [reactivated](/docs/learn/devices/manage#reactivate-a-device). During reactivation, devices briefly enter the `activating` state before transitioning back to `online`.

To view the status of a device, simply hover over the device's name on the [Devices page](/docs/learn/devices/overview#devices-page).
