## Properties

The following properties are used to identify and manage a device. 

<ParamField path="name">

<MutableBadge />

A human-readable display name that can contain most characters such as spaces, special characters, and punctuation. Must contain between 1 and 48 characters.

Examples: `Robot 11`, `ArcticBlaze`, `Scooby Doo`

<ParamField path="status">

<MutableBadge />

The [status](/docs/guides/devices/overview#status) of the device.

Examples: `inactive`, `activating`, `online`, `offline`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="current_release_id">

<MutableBadge />

The current release of the device.

Examples: `inactive`, `activating`, `online`, `offline`

</ParamField>

## Miru Agent

Configurations are deployed to devices via the [Miru Agent](/docs/developers/agent/intro), a lightweight `systemd` service that runs on your devices, handling the deployment lifecycle of configurations. 

The Miru agent offers the following functionality:

- **Syncs configurations** from the cloud to the local filesystem in real-time
- **Manages device state**, providing real-time updates of the device's status and the currently deployed configurations
- **Exposes a [REST API](/docs/references/agent-api/intro)** over a Unix socket for programmatic access by applications running on the same machine

<Warning>
  The Miru Agent only supports Linux. Visit the [supported platforms](/docs/developers/agent/intro#supported-platforms) for a complete list of supported platforms.
</Warning>

## Status

Devices leverage several states to track their registration and connectivity with the Miru servers.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `inactive` | Device has been created; Miru agent has not been installed |
| `activating` | The Miru agent is registering itself with Miru servers |
| `online` | Device is currently connected to Miru's servers |
| `offline` | Device has lost connection to Miru's servers |

Devices begin in the `inactive` state. During the Miru agent install process, devices briefly enter the `activating` state before transitioning to `online`.

Once the Miru agent has been activated on a device, the device remains `online` or `offline` for the remainder of its existence--devices don't transition back to `inactive` or `activating`.

The only exception to this is when a device is [reactivated](/docs/guides/devices/manage#reactivate-a-device). During reactivation, devices briefly enter the `activating` state before transitioning back to `online`.

To view the status of a device, simply hover over the device's name on the [Devices page](/docs/guides/devices/overview#devices-page).
