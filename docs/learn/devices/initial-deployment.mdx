title: "Initial deployment"

The initial deployment is the very first deployment delivered to a device. Since initial deployments have no predecessors, their workflow differs slightly from [editing configurations](/docs/learn/devices/config-editor).

## Overview

To create a device's initial deployment, navigate to the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices).

Only devices that been [provisioned](/docs/learn/devices/provision), but never deployed to, are candidates for an initial deployment.

You can identify these devices by their **Release** column. If their release column displays a placeholder text of **Set** instead of a release version (i.e. `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.), then the device is a candidate for an initial deployment.

Continue by clicking into the device you want to initialize. Since the device has no deployments deployed, a dialog will appear listing the releases to choose from to create the initial deployment.

<Info>
  If no releases are shown, you will need to [create a release](/docs/learn/releases/manage#create-a-release) before continuing.
</Info>

At this point, you have two options: deploy a staged deployment or create a new deployment.

## Staged deployments

If you've [staged a deployment](/docs/learn/releases/staging-area) on the chosen release for the device, the release will have the `Staged` badge next to it.

Select a release with a `Staged` badge and hit **Next**.

</Frame>

The deployment staged on this release will appear in the dialog. Select the deployment and hit **Deploy**.

## New deployments

If the release you selected has no staged deployments, you'll immediately be presented with a dialog to create a new deployment.

</Frame>

The dialog includes a tab for each config schema defined in the release, each pre-populated with the schema's default values.

Make any desired edits to the config instances, enter a description at the bottom of the dialog, and hit **Deploy**.
