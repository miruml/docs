title: "Initial deployment"
---

The initial deployment is the very first deployment delivered to a device. Since initial deployments have no predecessors, their workflow looks a bit different from [editing configurations](/docs/learn/devices/config-editor).

## Overview

To create a device's initial deployment, begin by navigating to the [Devices page](https://app.miruml.com/devices).

Only devices which have been [provisioned](/docs/learn/devices/provision), but have never deployed to, are candidates for an initial deployment. 

You can identify these devices by their **Release** column. If their release column dsplays a placeholder text of **Set** instead of a release version (i.e. `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.), then the device is a candidate for an initial deployment.

Continue by clicking into the device you want to initialize. Since the device doesn't have anything deployed, a dialog will appear displaying the releases to choose from to create the initial deployment.

<Info>
  If no releases are shown, you will need to [create a release](/docs/learn/releases/manage#create-a-release) before continuing.
</Info>

At this point, you have two options: deploy a staged deployment or create a new deployment.

## Staged deployments

If you've [staged a deployment](/docs/learn/releases/staging-area) on the chosen release for the device, the release will have the `Staged` badge next to it.

</Frame>

Select a release with a `Staged` badge and hit **Next**.

</Frame>

The deployment staged on this release will appear in the dialog. Simply select the deployment and hit **Deploy**.

## New deployments

If the release you selected does not have any staged deployments, you'll immediately be presented with a dialog to create a new deployment.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/devices/editor/set-release-dialog:step2:config-tabs.png)
</Frame>

A dialog will appear with tabs for each config schema defined in the release. The tabs are pre-populated with the schema's default values.

Make any desired edits to the config instances, enter a description at the bottom of the dialog, and hit **Deploy**.
