## Overview

The staging area for a release is a place to create deployments in preparation for a future rollout.

Deployments may freely be created without being deployed to devices, an ideal place to prepare and review deployments before being rolled out.

Every release has its own staging area that is completely separate from other release's staging areas. As such, devices can have deployments staged for multiple releases at the same time.

The staging area is also handy for batch operations. Deployments may be created, deployed, and archived in bulk, helpful for managing large numbers of deployments at once.

## View the staging area

To view a release's staging area, navigate to the [Releases page](https://app.miruml.com/releases) and click into a release.

Then select the **Stage** tab at the top of the page.

## Stage a deployment
 
To stage a deployment, click the **Stage Deployment** button in the top right.

A dialog will appear with tabs for each config schema defined in the release. The tabs are pre-populated with the schema's default values.

Make any desired edits to the config instances in the deployment, enter a description at the bottom of the dialog, and hit **Next**.

Select the device(s) to stage this deployment for.

If a device is unavailable for selection, that device currently has a `deployed` deployment for this release. To update the deployment for that device, make your edits in the device's [config editor](/docs/learn/deployments/config-editor).
