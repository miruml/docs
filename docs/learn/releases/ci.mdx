Instead of creating releases manually, you can automate the process using a continuous integration (CI) tool.

CI pipelines leverage the [Miru CLI](/docs/references/cli/intro) to programmatically execute any CLI commands, which accepts API keys for authentication. Before continuing, we recommend familiarizing yourself with [creating releases](/docs/learn/releases/create) via the CLI first.

For a concise overview of setting up a CI pipeline for creating releases, continue reading below. For more detailed CI information, visit the [CI documentation](/docs/developers/ci/overview).

## API key scopes

To authenticate the CLI in your CI pipeline, create an API key as described in the [API keys](/docs/admin/apikeys) documentation using the following scopes:

  - `config_schemas:manage`
  - `git_commits:manage`
  - `releases:manage`
