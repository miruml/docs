<Info>
  If you don't have any config types or schemas to choose from, first [create a config type](/docs/learn/config-types#create-a-config-type), then [create a schema](/docs/learn/schemas/create).
</Info>

Only one config schema per config type can be included in a release. By default, the latest schema for each config type is chosen. To select a different version, click the dropdown for the config type and select the desired version.

To view the schema's content and metadata, hover over the schema and click the **View** button.
