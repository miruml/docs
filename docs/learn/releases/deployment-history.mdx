Each release has its own deployment history, which is accessible by clicking into the release from the [Releases page](https://app.miruml.com/releases) and selecting the **Deployments** tab.

Unlike the staging area, the deployment history page lists *all* deployments for a release: `staged`, `deployed`, `archived`, etc. If a deployment has been created for this release, you can find it in the deployment history page.
