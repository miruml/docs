Each release has its own deployment history, which is accessible by clicking into the release from the [Releases page](https://app.miruml.com/releases) and selecting the **Deployments** tab.

Unlike the staging area, the deployment history page lists *all* deployments for a release: `staged`, `deployed`, `archived`, etc. If a deployment has been created for this release, you can find it in the deployment history page.

## View a deployment

To view a deployment, select the deployment from the list of deployments.

A panel will open on the right of the page displaying the deployment's details.

## View a config instance

To view the details of any config instances in the deployment, click into the config instance in the **Configurations** section of the deployment panel opened in the previous section. 

<Frame>
  ![](/images/deployments/deployed-panel:configurations.png)
</Frame>

The content tab contains the parameters in the config instance while the metadata tab contains audit information--the author, creation date, description, etc.
