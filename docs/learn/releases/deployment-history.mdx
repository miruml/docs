Each release has its own deployment history, accessible by clicking the release on the [Releases page](https://app.miruml.com/releases) and selecting the **Deployments** tab.

Unlike the staging area, the deployment history page lists _all_ deployments for a release: `staged`, `deployed`, `archived`, etc. If a deployment has been created for this release, you can find it in the deployment history page.

## View a deployment

To view a deployment, select it from the list.

A panel will open on the right of the page displaying the deployment's details.

## View a config instance

To view the details of any config instances in the deployment, click into the config instance in the **Configurations** section of the deployment panel opened in the previous section.

The content tab contains the config instance's parameters, while the metadata tab contains audit information--the author, creation date, description, etc.
