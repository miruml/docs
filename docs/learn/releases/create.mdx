INTRO

Config schemas can **only be created via the command line**.

This is a deliberate design choice—we believe schemas should live in a Git repository. This allows them to be versioned alongside the code that uses them and encourages better software development practices.

Ideally, schemas are versioned in the same repository as the code that uses them. However, this is not a requirement. You may use any Git repository to house your schemas.

## Command line

## Prerequisites

To create a schema, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. CLI installed - [install](/docs/references/cli/install) the Miru CLI on your development machine and authenticate using the [login](/docs/references/cli/login) command
2. Config type created - create a [config type](/docs/learn/config-types) to house the schema

## Define the schema

Begin by defining your schema using a supported schema [language](/docs/learn/schemas/languages/overview). You can find example schemas in our [getting-started repository](https://github.com/mirurobotics/getting-started).

If you're not sure which language to use, we recommend starting with JSON Schema — it's the most widely used and easiest to get started with.

To get started quickly, feel free to use an empty schema, which considers all config instances as valid.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml JSON Schema
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
```


```cue CUE
{}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Annotations

Annotations are a convenient way to store schema metadata with your schema. Most annotations are optional, but some are required for Miru to process the schema correctly.

## Git metadata

When pushing a schema to Miru, the CLI captures Git metadata from the *local* Git repository from which the CLI is run:

- **Commit SHA** - the SHA of the current commit that the schema is defined in
- **Origin URL** - the remote URL of the Git repository
- **File path** - the path to the schema file within the repo

This metadata is then made available in the dashboard for each schema, making it easy to trace the origin of each schema.

While Git metadata is captured from the local Git repository, only origin URLs from the following providers are supported:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

If your Git repository is hosted on a different provider, please reach out to 

### Requirements

To be able to capture Git metadata, schemas must meet the following requirements when uploading from the CLI:

- The schema must be defined in a local Git repository
- The Git repository must have a remote URL (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- The schema's latest changes must be committed to the Git repository before pushing to Miru (cannot be dirty or unstaged)

Git metadata is not optional. If a schema does not meet these requirements, the CLI will return an error and fail to push the schema.

## Push the schema

Once you've defined a schema and committed it to Git, you're ready to push it to Miru via the CLI.

To push a schema, replace `{path/to/schema.yaml}` with the actual path to the schema file.

```bash
miru schema push {path/to/schema.yaml}
```

## Continuous integration

## Dashboard

To create a release, click the **New Release** button in the top-right and enter a version.

<Frame>
  ![](https://assets.mirurobotics.com/docs/v02/images/releases/create-dialog-step1.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
  The version must be a [semantic version](https://semver.org/). See the [release properties](/docs/learn/releases/overview#properties) for more information.
</Info>

Click **Next,** then select the config schemas to include in the release.

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Info>
  If you don't have any config types or schemas to choose from, first [create a config type](/docs/learn/config-types#create-a-config-type), then [create a schema](/docs/learn/schemas/create).
</Info>

Only one config schema per config type can be included in a release. By default, the latest schema for each config type is chosen. To select a different version, click the dropdown for the config type and select the desired version.

To view the schema's content and metadata, hover over the schema and click the **View** button.

Once you're satisfied with the selected schemas, hit **Create**.
