## Properties

<ParamField path="target status" type="string">

<EditableBadge />

The desired state of the config instance, inherited from its [owner](/docs/learn/config-instances#owners-and-origins) deployment.

Visit the deployment's [target status](/docs/learn/deployments#target-status) for more information.

Enum: `staged`, `deployed`, `archived`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="activity status" type="string">

<MutableBadge />

The last known activity state of the config instance, inherited from its [owner](/docs/learn/config-instances#owners-and-origins) deployment.

Visit the deployment's [activity status](/docs/learn/deployments#activity-status) for more information.

Enum: `staged`, `needs_review`, `queued`, `deployed`, `removing`, `archived`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="error status" type="string">

<MutableBadge />

The last known error state of the config instance, inherited from its [owner](/docs/learn/config-instances#owners-and-origins) deployment.

Visit the deployment's [error status](/docs/learn/deployments#error-status) for more information.


Enum: `none`, `failed`, `retrying`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="status" type="string">

<MutableBadge />

This property merges the `activity status` and `error status`
fields, with error states taking precedence over activity states when errors
are present. 

Below are some examples of the status given different activity and error states.

| Activity Status | Error Status | Status |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| `created`       | `none`       | `created` |
| `deployed`      | `none`       | `deployed` |
| `queued`        | `retrying`   | `retrying` |
| `removed`       | `failed`     | `failed` |

Enum: `staged`, `needs_review`, `queued`, `deployed`, `removing`, `archived`, `failed`, `retrying`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="content" type="object">

<ImmutableBadge />

The configuration values that are deployed to the device in the format of a JSON object.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="file path" type="string">

<ImmutableBadge />

The file path the config instance is deployed to relative to the `/srv/miru/config_instances` directory.

A file path of `/v1/motion-control.json` deploys the config instance to `/srv/miru/config_instances/v1/motion-control.json`.

Examples: `/v1/motion-control.json`, `/safety.json`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="parent" type="Config Instance">

<ImmutableBadge />{' '}<NullableBadge />

The config instance that this config instance was patched from. 

Examples: `CFG-Cpa13`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="config schema" type="Config Schema">

<ImmutableBadge />

The [config schema](/docs/learn/schemas/overview#properties) which the config instance must adhere to.

Example: `SCH-FmoDN`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="device" type="Device">

<ImmutableBadge />

The [device](/docs/learn/devices/overview#properties) which the config instance is deployed to.

Examples: `Sojourner`, `Johnny Test`, `Robot 11`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="origin" type="Deployment">

<ImmutableBadge />

The [deployment](/docs/learn/deployments#properties) with which the config instance was created. Visit the [origin](/docs/learn/config-instances#owners-and-origins) section for more information.

Example: `DPL-123`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="owner" type="Deployment">

<MutableBadge />

The [deployment](/docs/learn/deployments#properties) that a config instance currently belongs to. Visit the [owner](/docs/learn/config-instances#owners-and-origins) section for more information.

Example: `DPL-123`

</ParamField>

## Formats

Currently, config instances only support JSON. However, support for more formats including YAML and JSON-C are coming soon!

## Owners and origins

Config instances aren't directly interacted with in Miru. Instead, instances are created and used as part of the [deployment](/docs/learn/deployments) to which they belong.

Each config instance has two key deployment relationships:

- **Origin** - the deployment with which the config instance was created
- **Owner** - the deployment that a config instance currently belongs to

These concepts are best explained with an example.

**Initial Deployment**

Let's say we create and deploy a new deployment, `DPL-MT3Ec`, containing config instances `CFG-K9xF6`, `CFG-BrM1v`, and `CFG-9ai6A`. The config instances are each an instantiation of the [config types](/docs/learn/config-types) `Mobility`, `Perception`, and `Safety` respectively.

![](/images/config-instances/ownership:step1.png)

Since the deployment is brand new, all three config instances's owner and origin is `DPL-MT3Ec`.

| Instance |  Owner | Origin |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **CFG-K9xF6 (Mobility)**    | **DPL-MT3Ec** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |
| **CFG-BrM1v (Perception)**     | **DPL-MT3Ec** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |
| **CFG-9ai6A (Safety)**     | **DPL-MT3Ec** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |

**Mobility Edit**

Now we make an edit to the `Mobility` config instance, which creates `DPL-8Xerr` and replaces `DPL-MT3Ec` with it. 

![](/images/config-instances/ownership:step2.png)

Since no edits were made to the `Perception` or `Safety` instances, our new deployment `DPL-8Xerr` reuses the config instances from `DPL-MT3Ec` for those config types. As such, the total number of config instances increases from three to four.

The new `Mobility` config instance, `CFG-6jrCj`, has an owner and origin of `DPL-8Xerr` since it was created with that deployment. 

The old `Mobility` config instance is removed and retains its owner as `DPL-MT3Ec`.

The other two config instances are more interesting though. Since `DPL-8Xerr` reuses the `Perception` and `Safety` instances, `CFG-BrM1v` and `CFG-9ai6A` have their ownership transferred to `DPL-8Xerr`. 

Below is our updated table of owners and origins.

| Instance |  Owner | Origin |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **CFG-K9xF6 (Mobility)**    | **DPL-MT3Ec** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |
| **CFG-BrM1v (Perception)**     | **DPL-8Xerr** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |
| **CFG-9ai6A (Safety)**     | **DPL-8Xerr** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |
| **CFG-6jrCj (Mobility)**    | **DPL-8Xerr** | **DPL-8Xerr** |

**Safety Edit**

To make sure things are crystal clear, let's say we make another edit. This time we edit the `Safety` config instance, which creates `DPL-8jVBY` to replace `DPL-8Xerr`.

![](/images/config-instances/ownership:step3.png)

As before, since no edits were made to the `Mobility` or `Perception` instances, our new deployment `DPL-8jVBY` reuses the config instances from `DPL-8Xerr` for those config types. The total number of config instances thus increases from four to five.

The new `Safety` config instance, `CFG-2kQ1b`, has an owner and origin of `DPL-8jVBY` since it was created with that deployment. 

The old `Safety` config instance is removed and retains its owner as `DPL-8Xerr`.

The other two config instances have their ownership transferred to `DPL-8jVBY`, leaving us with our final table of owners and origins.

| Instance |  Owner | Origin |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **CFG-K9xF6 (Mobility)**    | **DPL-MT3Ec** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |
| **CFG-BrM1v (Perception)**     | **DPL-8Xerr** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |
| **CFG-9ai6A (Safety)**     | **DPL-8jVBY** | **DPL-MT3Ec** |
| **CFG-6jrCj (Mobility)**    | **DPL-8jVBY** | **DPL-8Xerr** |
| **CFG-2kQ1b (Safety)**    | **DPL-8jVBY** | **DPL-8jVBY** |
