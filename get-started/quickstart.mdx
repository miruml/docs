## Setup your development

**[Miru](https://app.miruml.com/signin)** is the deployment infrastructure for robotics
and IoT. Miru makes it easy to deploy software over-the-air to fleets of devices, 
anywhere in the world. Simply push new changes to GitHub and let Miru take care of 
the rest.

This **Getting Started** page will walk you through an example set up and 
deployment using Miru. Please note that, currently Miru is only compatible 
with **NVIDIA Jetson**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **Orange Pi** running **Ubuntu**.

For requests for other devices/OS support, [reach out to a founder](mailto:vedant@miruml.com). **Do not use this in production without talking to a founder first!**

### Connect to GitHub 
<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon = 'github' title = 'Install the GitHub App' id = 'install-github-app'>

  Miru integrates with your GitHub account for a seamless deployment experience.
  While you may connect any repositories of your choosing, this guide will walk
  you through an example deployment using the *Miru Examples repository*.

  To use this repository with us, click [Miru Examples repository](https://github.com/miruml/examples) and fork the
  repository by clicking the Fork button in the top right of the repository
  screen on GitHub.

  <img src="/images/fork.png" style={{borderRadius: '7px'}} />

  Rename the repository to *miru-examples* and choose the owner as your personal
  GitHub account (we're using *mirueng*). If using an organization's account, the organization owner may
  need to grant you permission to fork the repository into the organization's
  namespace and create a new repository.

  <img src="/images/fork-repo-name.png" />

  You should now see the *miru-examples* repository on your GitHub account.

  <img height="200" src="/images/forked-miru-examples.png" />

   Navigate to the [settings](https://app.miruml.com/settings/integrations) page in Miru and click **Connect** to connect your GitHub account.

  <img height="200" src="/images/connect-github.png" />

  Select the GitHub account that you just created the repository with. For us, that's *miru-eng*.

  <img height="200" src="/images/install-gh-app.png" />

  Select the **miru-examples** repository to grant Miru access and click **Save**. You can add other repositories or change Miru's access to your GitHub repositories
  at any time. If you're adding Miru under an GitHub organization account, the organization owner may need to grant Miru access themselves.

  <img height="200" src="/images/select-gh-repos.png" />

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon = 'code-branch' title = 'Create a GitHub Source' id = 'create-github-source'>
 

  After the installation completes, you'll be redirected to the
  [settings](https://app.miruml.com/settings/integrations) page in Miru. Wait a
  few seconds before refreshing the page to see your updated repository access.

  <img height="200" src="/images/miru-examples-on-miru.png" />

  After connecting a GitHub repository, you'll need to create a **GitHub Source**. A GitHub Source is uniquely identified by three items:

  1. Repository - the GitHub repository (ex: miru-examples)
  2. Branch - the branch for the repository (ex: main)
  3. Build Directory - the folder in the repository housing a docker-compose.yaml file (ex: /backend)

  <div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
  }}>
  <img height="200" src="/images/todo-source.png" style={{ 
    flex: 1,
    maxWidth: '250px',
    marginRight: '40px',
  }} />
  <p style={{ flex: 1}}>
    Note that you can create multiple sources from the same repository, provided
    each source has a unique branch and build directory combination.

    To create a GitHub source, click the **Source** button, fill in the fields,
    and click **Create Source**. We'll set up our GitHub source to track the
    `\todo` in the `main` branch of our forked `miru-examples` repository and name
    the source *To Do*. 
  </p>
  </div>

  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Create a Device
<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="layer-plus" title="Create a Device Group" id = 'create-a-device-group'>
    Navigate to the devices page and create a Device Group. Device Groups are a
    convenient way to organize your devices. You might create a group for a
    specific functionality, different customers, a set of test devices, etc.  

    <img height="200" src="/images/device-group.png" />

    In general, device groups are meant to organize your devices. You can use devices of different hardware types (NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, etc.) in the same group as well easily move devices between groups later if you'd like. 

    <div style={{
      display: 'flex',
      flexDirection: 'row',
      alignItems: 'center',
      justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    }}>
    <p style={{ flex: 1}}>
      Each Device Group is connected to one or more GitHub sources. This allows you to use multiple GitHub sources (from potentially different repositories) to deploy code to your devices. On the other hand, you can use the same GitHub sources across different groups so that groups or organized by customer or region, but the devices in the group still have the same code being deployed to them.

      When creating a Device Group, simply name the group and select the GitHub
      Source. We'll name ours *Example Group* and set the GitHub Source to be the
      *To Do* source we just created.
    </p>
    <img height="200" src="/images/edit-group.png" style={{ 
      flex: 1,
      maxWidth: '300px',
      marginLeft: '40px',
    }} />
    </div>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Create a Device" id = 'create-a-device'>
    First click into the Device Group you want to add your device to. We'll use the Development Group.

    <img src="/images/select-group.png" />

    Click the Device button in the top right-hand corner.

    <img src="/images/create-device.png" />

    Simply fill in the prompted information to name your device, choose the hardware, etc. Don't stress about getting it right the first time, you can easily change this information later.
   
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Edit a Device" id='move-a-device'>

    To edit a device, find the device on the Group page and click the ellipsis on the far right. Then select the "Edit" button.

    <img src="/images/device-on-group-page.png" />

    From you here you can change the device's group, edit it's name, or select a different hardware.

    <img src="/images/edit-device.png" width="300" />

### Install Miru onto your Device

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="arrow-down-to-line" title="Install Miru" id = 'install-miru'>

  Installing Miru onto your device takes ~ 3 minutes.  The only dependencies for Miru are `docker`, `docker compose`, and `miru`. If you don't have `docker` or `docker compose` installed already don't worry, Miru will handle the installation for you! 

  We highly recommend **to SSH into your device** so that you can easily copy and paste your authentication token from your local computer.

  Please note that **only arm64/aarch64 is supported** at this time. Miru is **incompatible with x86_64/x64.**

  #### 1. **Install `miru`**

  Run the following command to install `miru`, which will download and execute this [installation script](https://miruml.notion.site/Miru-Installation-Script-b7d6895d7d8d40cb868987585dc4a65b). 

  {/* Should I keep this on Notion or make a Mintlify page? */}
  ```
  curl https://api.miruml.com/v1/install.sh -sSf | sudo /bin/sh
  ```
  `curl`: curl is a command-line tool used to transfer data from or to a server. In this case we're using it to download the `miru` installation script shell script from the Miru servers to your local computer.
    {/* Toggle for curl installation instructions */}
    <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="If `curl` is not installed">
      Install it with the following two commands:
      
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      ```
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install curl
      ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="question" title="Want to know how the command works?">
    - `http://api.miruml.com/v1/install.sh`: The URL which resolves to the Miru servers for the curl request
    - `s`: Runs `curl` in silent mode, suppressing progress and error messages.
    - `S`: In combination with `s`, it makes `curl` show error messages if any occur.
    - `f`: Makes `curl` fail silently (without outputting the body) on server errors (e.g., 404 or 500 HTTP status codes).
    - `|` (pipe): The pipe (`|`) is a Unix command that takes the output of the command on its left (in this case, the output of `curl`) and uses it as the input to the command on its right.
    - `sudo`: Runs the following command (`/bin/bash`) with superuser (root) privileges. This is needed to install `miru` as a Debian package
    - `/bin/sh`: The Shell, which is used to execute the `miru` installation script on your local system.
    
    </Accordion>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="docker" title="Install/Upgrade Docker" id = 'install-docker'>
      If you don't have docker installed already, don't worry. Miru will handle the installation for you. First, select the OS your device is running on. Currently, Miru only supports Ubuntu.

      <pre><code className="language-bash">
      ? We've autodetected your operating system to be Ubuntu.
      Please confirm this selection or, if this is incorrect, please select your operating system from the list below:
      ‚ùØ  Ubuntu
      Raspberry Pi
      Other
      </code></pre>
      
      The `miru` installer will quickly test if Docker is installed on your device and if it is compatible with `miru`. 
    
      <pre><code className="language-bash">
      Miru requires Docker and Docker Compose (Version 2!)
      To ensure compatibility with Miru, we will quickly test your Docker installation with our software

      \ Testing Docker Installation
      </code></pre>

      If Docker is not installed or is not compatible with `miru`, you'll be asked to let the `miru` installer install/upgrade Docker for you. This is done using [this bash script](https://miruml.notion.site/Docker-Installation-Script-e11b5fd27f8547b1ab4622913dd18447?pvs=4), which executes the [Official Docker Installation Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) for the OS your device is running on. 
      If you're upgrading your Docker installation, existing Docker resources (containers, images, networks, etc.) **will be left untouched** and will continue running after the installation is complete.
      {/* TODO: Should I make this on a Mintlify page?*/}
      Once the bash script completes, the `miru` installer will again test if the Docker installation is compatible (which it should be), after which it will automatically move on to authenticating your device. 

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="key" title="Authenticate" id = 'authenticate-device'>
    To authenticate your device, navigate to the group your device lives in and select the device you want to authenticate. Click the key icon at the far right of the device's row to retrieve its authentication token.

    <img src="/images/authenticate.png" />

    A short-lived token will be granted to you.

    <img src="/images/JWT.png" width="400"/>

   Copy and paste this token into the **Enter your Authentication Token** prompt on your device.

  ```
   To authenticate your device, you'll need to retrieve its 
  authentication token from the Miru Web Application.

    ? Enter your Authentication Token ‚Ä∫ eyJhbGciOiJIUzI...

   ```

   After entering your authentication token and successful authentication, your device is ready to deploy with `miru`!

  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Create an Artifact
<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="docker" title="Prepare your Application" id = 'prepare-deployment'>
    Miru utilizes [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to deploy your application. This section will walk through the setup of your application with Docker Compose to deploy to `miru`. We'll use the [Miru Examples repository](https://github.com/miruml/demo) you forked in the [Connect to GitHub](#install-the-github-app) section. 

    Ensure you're using a **development machine** for this section. This should be a computer that has pull/push access to your GitHub account. We recommend using a computer different from the device you installed `miru` onto. Although, you could use the same device if that's all you have access to.


  First clone your ***miru-examples*** repository.

  ``` bash
    # your repo url should like similar to: https://github.com/<your-username>/miru-examples.git
    # ours is https://github.com/miru-eng/miru-examples.git when using the 'miru-eng' account
    git clone YOUR-MIRU-EXAMPLE-REPOSITORY-URL
  ```

  Navigate inside the ***miru-examples*** directory.

  ``` bash
  cd miru-examples
  ```

  Your directory structure should look similar to the following:

  ```plaintext
  miru-examples/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todo/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple-torch/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ```

  Open the **/todo** directory in your favorite code editor to examine the code and containers that will be deployed onto your device. While there are other folders within the miru-examples repository, we setup a singel GitHub Source in our Device Group, which looks at the **todo** folder. This was specified by inputting the build path as **/todo** when [creating the Device Group](#create-a-device-group).
 

  The todo folder has the following structure:

  ```plaintext
  todo/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compose.yaml
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ```
 
    The first (and maybe most important) file is the `compose.yaml` file. This specifies what docker services (containers) to run, how they should interact with the host machine, and how to build or pull the images these services will run. 
  
    <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="`compose.yaml`">
    ```yaml
    name: todo
    services:
      frontend:
        build:
          context: frontend
          target: development
        ports:
          - 3000:3000
        stdin_open: true
        volumes:
          - /usr/src/app/node_modules
        restart: always
        networks:
          - react-express
        depends_on:
          - backend

      backend:
        restart: always
        build:
          context: backend
          target: development
        volumes:
          - /usr/src/app/node_modules
        depends_on:
          - mongo
        networks:
          - express-mongo
          - react-express
        expose: 
          - 3000
      mongo:
        restart: always
        image: mongo:4.2.0
        volumes:
          - mongo_data:/data/db
        networks:
          - express-mongo
        expose:
          - 27017
    networks:
      react-express:
      express-mongo:

    volumes:
      mongo_data:
   ```
    
  </Accordion>
  
    For example, the **frontend** service contains the following build specification:

    ```yaml
    frontend:
      build:
        context: frontend
        target: development
      ...
    ```

    The `frontend.build` parameters specify where the Dockerfile for this service is located in the filesystem and any information required to build the Docker image. 

    The `frontend.build.context` parameter tells Docker Compose to look inside the **frontend** directory that is located within the parent directory of the **compose.yaml** file's parent directory. For example, since the compose.yaml file's path is **/todo/compose.yaml**, Docker Compose will look for a Dockerfile at **/todo/frontend/Dockerfile**.

    Similarly, the **backend** service's build specification is:

    ```yaml
    backend:
      build:
        context: backend
        target: development
    ```
    So Docker Compose will look for the backend service's Dockerfile at `/todo/backend/Dockerfile`. If you look within these folders you'll find Dockerfiles in each of them.

    ```plaintext
    todo/
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compose.yaml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ```
    The Dockerfiles specify how to build their respective service (frontend or backend) into a [Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/build/). This process is crucial for creating a consistent and reproducible environment for the application.

    The **mongo** service is the last service defined in the compose.yaml file. Notably, it does not have a build parameter. Instead, it uses an image parameter ([mongo:4.2.0](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)) to specify the Docker image to pull from Docker Hub. This approach ensures that the service uses a specific version of the MongoDB image.

    ```yaml
    mongo:
      restart: always
      image: mongo:4.2.0
    ```

    These services work together to create a simple web application that can be accessed on localhost to create a ToDo list. After deploying this application, you will be able to navigate to localhost on the device in which the application is deployed and see the following:

    <img height="200" src="/images/todo-app.png" />


  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="hammer" title="Build an Artifact" id = 'build-an-artifact'>

    To use `miru` with your docker compose setup, simply ensure your **docker-compose.yml** is located in the directory specified by your GitHub Source. For us that would be **.../miru-examples/todo/compose.yml** since we specified our GitHub Source directory to be **/todo** and our repository lives in the **miru-examples** directory. Your compose file can be named **compose** or **docker-compose** with a file extension of **yaml** or **yml** (compose.yml, compose.yaml, docker-compose.yml, or docker-compose.yaml).

    Ensure you're using a **development machine** for this section. This should be a computer that has pull/push access to your GitHub account. We recommend using a computer different from the device you installed `miru` onto. Although, you could use the same device if that's all you have access to.

    With our application ready, we'll navigate back to our **miru-examples** repository, add a change, and push to GitHub.

    ```
    # This is an arbitrary change to push a new commit to GitHub
    # Feel free to push whatever arbitrary change you'd like 
    echo "Hello Miru!" >> miru.txt
    git add .
    git commit -m "Test Miru deployment"
    ```
    Upon pushing to GitHub, Miru receives the push event and begins building your containers on our servers. You'll be able to see the progress of this **Artifact** being built on the **Group** page the device is located in.

    <img src="/images/queued-artifact.png" />

    Your artifact will transition through 5 different states before it is ready for deployment.

    1. **Queued** -> Waiting for a build server to become available to build your artifact
    2. **Verifying** -> Verifying your Docker Compose file and build specifications are valid
    3. **Building** -> Building your Docker images
    4. **Storing** -> Storing your images in our private container registry
    5. **Ready** -> The artifact is ready to be deployed to your devices.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="box-open" title="Using Artifacts" id = 'using-artifacts'>
    At the top of a group's page, you'll find **Staged Artifacts**. These are the artifacts which are available to deploy to your devices. By default, newly created artifacts are placed in the staging area and are NOT deployed to your devices. Deployments only occur if you explicitly do so via the UI (more on this in later sections).

    For convenience, you can see the artifact's ID, Git commit, and GitHub source. To see more information about an artifact, click on the artifact's ID. Alternatively, click the ellipsis on the far right and select "Inspect". To move an artifact out of the staging area, select the "Archive" option after clicking the ellipsis for that artifact.

    <img src="/images/staged-artifacts.png" />

    Archived artifacts can be found on the **Artifacts** page within a group (top left next the **Group** page). Here you can see the history of all artifacts, including staged artifacts, for a given group. You can easily sort and search them for more information. If you want to put an artifact back in the staging area, click the ellipsis on the far right and select "Restage".

    <img src="/images/artifacts-history.png" />

    If we inspect an artifact (click on it's ID), we'll see all the information about it including the `miru` and Docker build logs. This is will give you any necessary troubleshooting information if the build fails for some reason.

    <img src="/images/artifact-failed-build.png" />

    You can also easily reference the build logs to know what was in your Dockerfiles as well as examine the steps our build servers executed to create your artifact.

    <img src="/images/artifact-built.png" />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy an Artifact
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="play" title="Deploy" id = 'deploy-application'>

  To deploy an artifact to your devices, click the ellipsis on the far right of the artifact you want to deploy.

  <img src="/images/staged-artifacts.png" />
  A popup will appear, allowing you to select which devices you would like to deploy the artifact to. Device's with a deployment already running the chosen artifact will not appear (since the artifact is already deployed). 

  <div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
  }}>
  <p style={{ flex: 1}}>
If a deployment currently on a device is from an artifact with the same GitHub source as the artifact being deployed, then the new deployment will replace this old deployment.
    
  For example, consider Artifact A and Artifact B, which both have the same GitHub Source C. If a device has a deployment running Artifact A and we're deploying Artifact B, the new deployment running Artifact B will replace the deployment running Artifact A. However, if Artifact B has GitHub Source D (instead of GitHub Source C), then the new deployment running Artifact B will simply deploy alongside the deployment running Artifact A (devices can run more than one deployment). 
  </p>
  <img height="200" src="/images/deploy-artifact-table.png" style={{ 
    flex: 1,
    maxWidth: '400px',
    marginLeft: '40px',
  }} />
  </div>
  
  After selecting the devices to deploy to and clicking "Deploy", the deployments will be queued, awaiting the devices to notice the new deployment and take appropriate action. 
  
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Verify your Deployment" id = 'verify-deployment'>
  
  Scrolling down to the Devices portion of the Group page, you'll find a preview of the information about the device. An overall device status as well as a count of the deployments and their containers are shown for convenience.


  <img src="/images/devices-during-deployment.png" />

  Clicking on the name of a device, we can see more detailed information, including the state of its deployments and containers. Each deployment shows its state (queued, downloading, running, etc.), the artifact ID it is running, the deployment ID, and the GitHub Source. By clicking the ellipsis for a deployment, you can start, stop, or remove a deployment from that device. 

  <img src="/images/device-details.png" />

  Scrolling down you'll find all the containers on the device. Again, clicking the ellipsis will allow you to start or stop a given container from the convenience of our UI.

  <img src="/images/device-containers.png" />
  
  To verify the deployment is running your device, open the terminal on your device and view its containers.

  ```
  docker ps 
  ```

  You should see 3 containers: a backend, a frontend, and mongo (the redis container is irrelevant here).
  ```
